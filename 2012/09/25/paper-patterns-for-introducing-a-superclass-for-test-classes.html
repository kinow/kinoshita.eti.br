<meta name="description" content="Few days ago we had SugarLoafPlop 2012 in Natal - RN It is a conference on pattern languages of programming. About six months ago I saw a tweet by Eduardo Guerra asking if anyone had some cases where certain patterns were applied. It was a big coincidence, since I was working on Apache Commons Functor and some Jenkins plugins, both projects with cases that could be used in his paper. So I joined Guerra and gave my small contribution to the paper that has been accepted for this edition of SugarLoafPlop. Guerra also went there to give a talk and participate in an open discussion about several papers, including ours. I simply love when these things happen, it was great work with Guerra, and even better for being able to use Open Source examples in our paper." />

    <p>Few days ago we had <a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/">SugarLoafPlop 2012</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com.br/maps?q=natal+-+rn&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=-23.682803,-46.595546&amp;sspn=0.653971,1.352692&amp;hnear=Natal+-+Rio+Grande+do+Norte&amp;t=m&amp;z=11">Natal - RN</a></p>

<p>It is a conference on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language" title="Pattern Language">pattern languages</a> of programming. About six months ago I saw a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/emguerra" title="Eduardo Guerra">Eduardo Guerra</a> asking if anyone had some cases where certain patterns were applied. It was a big coincidence, since I was working on <a href="http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/functor/" title="Apache Commons Functor">Apache Commons Functor</a> and some <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins-CI">Jenkins plugins</a>, both projects with cases that could be used in his paper.</p>

<p>So I joined Guerra and gave my small contribution to the paper that <a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/pages/acceptedpapers.html" title="accepted papers">has been accepted</a> for this edition of SugarLoafPlop. Guerra also went there to give a talk and participate in an open discussion about several papers, including ours.</p>

<p>I simply love when these things happen, it was great work with Guerra, and even better for being able to use Open Source examples in our paper.</p>
