both can be a bit tricky. And there are probably more than one way of doing it. So
I am not claiming the route we went is the best.</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2020-03-28-using-lumino-with-vue/01.png alt title width height><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The main component for this integration is called <code>Lumino</code>. It has an array in its
<code>data</code> section that holds one entry for each widget that must be added to the Lumino
<code>BoxPanel</code>. The array can contain anything, like booleans or numbers. It holds the
ID of each widget added. This ID is the actual HTML element ID, and is used in the code
by even listeners to activate, delete, and maintain the state of the Lumino widgets and
the Vue components.</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2020-03-28-using-lumino-with-vue/02.png alt title width height><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The <code>BoxPanel</code> goes into a <code>div</code> created in the component template, exclusively for
Lumino.</p><p>As Lumino stars working with the DOM before Vue has had time to move things
from the virtual DOM, we need to compensate by asking Vue to wait before</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2020-03-28-using-lumino-with-vue/03.png alt title width height><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The final step in the integration are wrappers for Vue components. These wrappers
represent the component, but are actually used to attach the component&rsquo;s HTML element
to the widget HTML element.</p><p>The <code>.appendChild</code> function in JS takes care of moving nodes within the DOM. And Vue
is smart enough to remove the element correctly. It should also take care of event
listeners automagically, but for safety I prefer to add and remove event listeners
myself.</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2020-03-28-using-lumino-with-vue/04.png alt title width height><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Through even listeners, and controlling when something from the virtual DOM
can access something from the DOM, and tricking Lumino into creating empty widgets
that later receive the HTML element from the wrapped Vue component, we get it
working with Vue in the same as Lumino works with JupyterLab.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/kinow/vue-lumino>https://github.com/kinow/vue-lumino</a></p><p>Categories:
