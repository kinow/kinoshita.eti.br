<p>I watched Shimura Ken (志村 けん) the first time doing his Bakatono-Sama character. With
a simple Japanese, still hard to understand his jokes, but luckily most of his videos were
translated to Portuguese or English.</p>
<p>He passed away a few days ago, so I looked for some of his old videos to remember him.
&ldquo;Jailbreak&rdquo; (脱獄物語) is a story about jailed Shimura. His daughter visits him in jail,
and after the guard leaves, Drift Ken starts explaining to his daughter his escape plan.</p>
<p>He demands her to bring some material to help him escape, and that&rsquo;s where the comedy
begins. Shimura Ken plays with Japanese words with similar meaning. That&rsquo;s a great way
to learn new vocabulary.</p>
<p>He asks for a hacksaw first 金鋸 (<strong>かねのこ</strong>, kanenoko), which his daughter confuses with a
baby turtle 亀の子 (<strong>かめのこ</strong>, kamenoko).</p>
<p>Next he asks for three items. The first item requested is powder 火薬 (<strong>かやく</strong> kayaku),
but she brings instead a suppository blister pack 座薬 (<strong>ざやく</strong> zayaku).</p>
<p>The second item are matches <strong>マッチ</strong> (macchi), but when he asks she simply slaps his hand
<strong>タッチ</strong> (tacchi). The final item he requests is a fuse 導火線 (<strong>どうかせん</strong> doukasen),
which she heards as <strong>すいません</strong> (suimasen), which means sorry.</p>
<p>In his last attempt to escape with the help of his daughter, he asks her to bring
a rasp <strong>やすり</strong> (yasuri). This time she does bring the right item, but just not
the right type.</p>
<p>She brings a sandpaper sheet 紙やすり (<strong>紙やすり</strong> kamiyasuri).</p>
