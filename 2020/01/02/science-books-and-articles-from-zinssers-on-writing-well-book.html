<meta name="description" content="“On Writing Well” is a book by William Zinsser, published for the first time in 1976 but already past its seventeenth edition. It is extremely well written - as it was expected for a book with such title - and also funny and simple to read. The book is full of excerpts and quotes from other books and articles, used as good or bad examples. In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists books and articles on the topic that were well written. This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition, except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked interesting, so I decided to include it anyway." />

In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists
books and articles on the topic that were well written.</p>

<p>This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition,
except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked
interesting, so I decided to include it anyway.</p>
