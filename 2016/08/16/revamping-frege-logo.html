    <p>For a while I had been wanting to try adding a flat colour to the Frege
logo. This weekend had some bit of spare time, and here is the result.</p>

<p>Submitted to the project as <a href="https://github.com/Frege/frege/pull/299/files">pull request #299</a>.</p>

<p>Current logo.</p>

<p><img class="ui centered large image" src="/assets/posts/2016-08-16-revamping-frege-logo/Frege_logo.png" alt="Frege current logo" /></p>

<p>And the updated logo.</p>

<p><img class="ui centered large image" src="/assets/posts/2016-08-16-revamping-frege-logo/Frege_logo_flat_colours.png" alt="Frege updated logo" /></p>

<p>The colour used was Flamingo (#EF4836), found in <a href="http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/">Flat UI Color Picker</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps not exactly revamping, since all I did was just change a colour. There were
adjustments to the bézier curves as well, to better align them, but I updated both
logos, not just the new one :-)</p>
