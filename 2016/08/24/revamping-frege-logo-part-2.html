<meta name="description" content="Last time I used Blender was around 2007 I think, in University. But the bad weather in Auckland gives me plenty of time to have fun checking out Blender again :-) Followed the following tutorials: How to create a 3D Logo in Blender Blender Tutorial Spinning Logo Here are the work in progress, created only with the bézier curve. Here’s the result after the mesh was created, and some material applied. Then using a plane as background, replacing the lamp by a sun, and tweaking a few parameters. And finally playing with animation. Not sure if there was a time line and animation controls in Blender the last time I used it, but the controls are not really complex. I had to combine both meshes into a single object, in order to add a bone and rotate it. That is why the logo got back to a single material. The angle of the camera could probably do with some tweaking as well. But it was my very first time animating in Blender. Some day if I get access to one of those 3D printers, I will check what are the requirements for printing this logo. Blender models can be downloaded here. Now back to programming :-)" />

    <p>Last time I used Blender was around 2007 I think, in University. But the bad weather in

<p>Followed the following tutorials:</p>

<p>Here are the work in progress, created only with the bézier curve.</p>

<p>But it was my very first time animating in Blender. Some day if I get access to one of those
3D printers, I will check what are the requirements for printing this logo.</p>
