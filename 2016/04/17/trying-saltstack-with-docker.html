We are having a rainy weekend in Auckland, so I decided to have another look at the Jenkins SaltStack Plug-in. But now since I was at home, I couldn’t use the VM’s that I had access to at work. So decided to look again at Docker or Vagrant images. After playing with a few images, I found bbinet/salt-master. It not only sets up a master, but also provides an easy way to enable the cherrypy API (necessary for the Jenkins plug-in). This post describes the steps that I took to have a running Salt Master with the API enabled. First you need to create some directories and files to use with the image. shell$ mkdir ~/master &amp;&amp; cd ~/master shell$ mkdir -p config/master.d/ shell$ vim config/master.d/api.conf The api.conf contains the SaltStack API configuration. You can change port, user and other settings if necessary. Just remember to add a credential in Jenkins for the plug-in. # File: api.conf external_auth: pam: saltapiuser: - .* - &#39;@runner&#39; - &#39;@wheel&#39; - &#39;@jobs&#39; rest_cherrypy: port: 8000 host: 0.0.0.0 disable_ssl: True static: /opt/molten static_path: /assets app: /opt/molten/index.html app_path: /molten The image also conveniently provides a script that is executed before the entry point (if provided). So we can also create a user for the API automatically when the image is created. shell$ vim config/before-exec.sh #!/bin/bash # File: before-exec.sh useradd saltapiuser echo -e &quot;nosecret\nnosecret\n&quot; | passwd saltapiuser exit 0 Also make the script executable. chmod +x config/before-exec.sh And finally start the container. docker run --name salt-master -v $PWD/config:/config \ -p 4505:4505 -p 4506:4506 -p 443:443 -p 8000:8000 \ bbinet/salt-master Once the container is running, you can go to http://localhost:8000 and log in as saltapiuser:nosecret, and also configure your plug-in in Jenkins.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Some weeks ago I started learning <a href="http://saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a> for a project at work. But I couldn’t
find a good Docker image for that and I had to ask the Ops team for some VM’s. We
are having a rainy weekend in Auckland, so I decided to have another look at the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/saltstack-plugin">Jenkins SaltStack Plug-in</a>.</p>

<p>But now since I was at home, I couldn’t use the VM’s that I had access to at
work. So decided to look again at Docker or Vagrant images. After playing
with a few images, I found <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bbinet/salt-master/">bbinet/salt-master</a>.
It not only sets up a master, but also provides an easy way to enable the cherrypy
API (necessary for the Jenkins plug-in).</p>

<p>This post describes the steps that I took to have a running Salt Master with the API
enabled. First you need to create some directories and files to use with the image.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>shell<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/master <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/master
shell<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> config/master.d/
shell<span class="nv">$ </span>vim config/master.d/api.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The api.conf contains the SaltStack API configuration. You can change port, user
and other settings if necessary. Just remember to add a credential in Jenkins
for the plug-in.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># File: api.conf</span>
external_auth:
  pam:
    saltapiuser:
      - .<span class="k">*</span>
      - <span class="s1">'@runner'</span>
      - <span class="s1">'@wheel'</span>
      - <span class="s1">'@jobs'</span>
rest_cherrypy:
  port: 8000
  host: 0.0.0.0
  disable_ssl: True
  static: /opt/molten
  static_path: /assets
  app: /opt/molten/index.html
  app_path: /molten
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The image also conveniently provides a script that is executed before the
entry point (if provided). So we can also create a user for the API automatically
when the image is created.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>shell<span class="nv">$ </span>vim config/before-exec.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c"># File: before-exec.sh</span>
useradd saltapiuser
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s2">"nosecret</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">nosecret</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> | passwd saltapiuser
<span class="nb">exit </span>0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also make the script executable.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">chmod</span> +x config/before-exec.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally start the container.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker run <span class="nt">--name</span> salt-master <span class="nt">-v</span> <span class="nv">$PWD</span>/config:/config <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">-p</span> 4505:4505 <span class="nt">-p</span> 4506:4506 <span class="nt">-p</span> 443:443 <span class="nt">-p</span> 8000:8000 <span class="se">\</span>
    bbinet/salt-master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the container is running, you can go to http://localhost:8000 and
log in as saltapiuser:nosecret, and also configure your plug-in
in Jenkins.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
