<meta name="description" content="My chrome died twice this morning. Checking the system logs I found some segmentation errors. Since it was not so recent version, I updated to the latest version of Chrome.

I know, I&#39;m a bit weird). If you are having the same problem, here&#39;s the list of actions that I did to fix it. TL;DR: Disable the Pepper Flash, as well as the Gnash or other flash libraries installed, download flash plug-in from http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ and enable it. Went to chrome:plugins and disabled the Pepper Flash. Now I was back at using the Gnash flash plug-in previously installed. Now, although I could watch to Youtube videos, my radio wasn&#39;t playing yet. Disabled all Flash plug-ins, went to http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ and got the latest version (tar.gz, since I&#39;m using Debian). Copied the libflashplayer.so to /opt/google/chrome/plugins Re-enabled the Shockwave Flash plug-in (you have to expand the details section, in order to be able to choose which version you want to enable And now I&#39;m happily writing this blog and code, listening to Salonika - Dublin City Ramblers.

    <p>My chrome died twice this morning. Checking the system logs I found some segmentation errors. Since it was not so recent version, I updated to the latest version of Chrome.
