I am **Bruno P. Kinoshita**, born in 84 in **Sao Paulo city**, Sao Paulo state, **Brazil**. 
And I am a typical Paulistano, but now based in the **Auckland** CBD, **New Zealand**.

Working with [**NIWA**](https://niwa.co.nz) on [**Cylc**](https://cylc.github.io), an Open Source cyclic
workflow meta-scheduler written in Python, and used by many countries to drive their NWP (numeric
weather prediction) forecast. Also an **Apache Software Foundation member**, and involved with Commons,
Jena, OpenNLP, and other Open Source projects.

<!--I started having fun with computers back in 98, and got my first job with computers years later working for a 
mobile carrier, in the VAS team. Back then I was a **Java developer**, but so far I've worked as 
*Software Quality Engineer* for about two years too, *Infrastructure Engineer* for about the same time, 
and lately I've been doing *DevOps* and *Data Analysis* projects.

Although I've had to wear different hats (even had my moment with *bioinformatics* :), 
I've always programmed in [Python](/tags/python), [Java](/tags/java), 
[Perl](/tags/perl), [R](/tags/r), [C and C++](/tags/c++), or some 
[other language](/tags/programming). 
In 2012 I've received the honor to become part of [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org) as 
an **Apache Commons Committer**!

Apart from <a href="/open-source.html">Open Source</a> and computers, I also like playing
musical instruments like guitar, mandolin, and the tin whistle. In sports, I enjoy climbing,
judo, slack lining, dancing, swimming, and sometimes working out in the gym. And I also
like <a href="/art">drawing</a>, <a href="/movies">watching movies</a>,
and <a href="/books">reading *science fiction*, Haruki Murakami and books assorted</a>.
Oh! And <a href="/theatre">theatre</a> too!

I've already been to *New Zealand*, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, 
South Africa, Fiji, Japan, and United States. And, as many Brazilians
(99% of the population I guess),  I'm mixed race. My dad's parents are from Kumamoto,
Japan, and my mom's parents are half Brazilian natives and half French (I think).-->
