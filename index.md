Hello! I am Bruno Kinoshita or “kinow”, born and raised in São Paulo city, Brazil. 
A typical _Paulistano_ but now based in Auckland CBD, Aotearoa New Zealand.

Head on to the blog for posts about languages, writing, music, and computer
programming. Or check out my portfolio where I post drawings, illustrations,
painting, and-what-not.
