### Scoliosis [halo gravity traction](https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/st-louis/halo-traction) treatment

>The halo is a ring device that is held in place on the skull using several pins. Once the ring is attached, traction is immediately applied through the halo, and gradually increased according to the direction of the physician. Traction can be used in beds, wheelchairs and on walkers. Weight is gradually added to the pulley system as the patient becomes more comfortable with the device.
