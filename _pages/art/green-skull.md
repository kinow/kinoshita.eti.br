note: "The Catacombs of Paris (French: Catacombes de Paris) are underground ossuaries in Paris, France, which hold the remains of more than six million people in a small part of a tunnel network built to consolidate Paris' ancient stone mines. Extending south from the Barri√®re d'Enfer (\"Gate of Hell\") former city gate, this ossuary was created as part of the effort to eliminate the city's overflowing cemeteries."
