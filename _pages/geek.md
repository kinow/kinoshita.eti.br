### Games

#### Phantasy Star 1

#### Final Fantasy Tactics

#### Wesnoth

#### Path of Exile

>In the 1990s, McPherson's big contribution to the world was protective eyewear for surgeons who were using a certain laser in the operating room.

And when he put them on, he saw something he'd never seen before - orange, the fluorescent orange cones on the field.
