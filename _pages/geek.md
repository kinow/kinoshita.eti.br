### Games

#### Phantasy Star 1

- Best site with maps, weapons guides, and walkthrough: https://www.pscave.com/

##### New community game

What would be necessary to create a new PS game, based or similar to PS1? I reckon re-using the game
resources would be enough, just a good plot and characters being necessary.

#### Final Fantasy Tactics

#### Wesnoth

#### Path of Exile

### Manga

### Interesting and useful inventions created by accident

- 1928, [penicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin#Discovery)

>in his laboratory in the basement of St Mary's Hospital in London (now part of Imperial College), Fleming noticed a Petri dish containing Staphylococci that had been mistakenly left open was contaminated by blue-green mould from an open window, which formed a visible growth. There was a halo of inhibited bacterial growth around the mould. Fleming concluded that the mould released a substance that repressed the growth and caused lysing of the bacteria.

- 1930, [smoke detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector#History)

>In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas had no effect on the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that paved the way for the modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.

- 2002, [Enchroma color blindness curing glasses](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/13/628907277/how-universities-and-businesses-are-trying-to-engineer-more-accidental-genius)

>In the 1990s, McPherson's big contribution to the world was protective eyewear for surgeons who were using a certain laser in the operating room. His friend Mike borrowed those operating room glasses one day on a Frisbee field. And when he put them on, he saw something he'd never seen before - orange, the fluorescent orange cones on the field.
