### Games

#### Phantasy Star 1

- Best site with maps, weapons guides, and walkthrough: https://www.pscave.com/

##### New community game

What would be necessary to create a new PS game, based or similar to PS1? I reckon re-using the game
resources would be enough, just a good plot and characters being necessary.

#### Final Fantasy Tactics

#### Wesnoth

#### Path of Exile

### Manga
