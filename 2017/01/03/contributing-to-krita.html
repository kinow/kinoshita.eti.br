in case I found any bugs, contribute back? Or maybe from time to time triage issues,
find low hanging ones, and send a patch?</p><p>Well, turns out the Krita project has a great community, and it is super easy to send
contributions. So far I submitted three patches, some were included in 3.x releases.</p><ul><li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366741"><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366741">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366741</a></a></li><li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364208"><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364208">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364208</a></a></li><li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374451"><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374451">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=374451</a></a></li></ul><p>While the patches are rather small, they are suggestions on how to fix memory
segmentation faults, or strange behaviours in the interface. For these issues,
I had to learn more about Qt components, signals and emitting events, and,
of course, work with pointers, arrays, Qt data structures, etc. In other words,
lots of (geek) fun!</p><p>In other words, by contributing to Krita, I am not only helping the project
and giving a little back to the community, but also refreshing my memory on
C and C++, and slowly learning Qt - which is not very hard if you worked with
Swing/AWT, Delphi, Visual Basic, Gtk, etc.</p><p>What are you waiting to contribute to Krita? The developers that maintain the
project answer tickets and questions posted to <a href=https://reddit.com/r/krita>reddit</a>
in a good time, and are extremely easy to work with.</p><p>Read more <a href=http://www.davidrevoy.com/article193/guide-building-krita-on-linux-for-cats>here</a> how to build from source, and
<a href=https://krita.org/en/get-involved/developers/>here</a> on how to submit patches.</p><p>Happy hacking!</p><p>Categories:
