<meta name="description" content="As I mentioned in the last post, I have been learning Qt and using C and C++ again. Since I used C and C++ more during university (about 10 years ago, phew), decided to read real code.

But some time ago I switched to Inkscape for vector graphics, which I use at work for presentations. So it was only natural to try Krita now. Since I was going to try Krita, I thought why not check out and build from source, and then in case I found any bugs, contribute back? Or maybe from time to time triage issues, find low hanging ones, and send a patch? Well, turns out the Krita project has a great community, and it is super easy to send contributions.

For these issues, I had to learn more about Qt components, signals and emitting events, and, of course, work with pointers, arrays, Qt data structures, etc. In other words, lots of (geek) fun! In other words, by contributing to Krita, I am not only helping the project and giving a little back to the community, but also refreshing my memory on C and C++, and slowly learning Qt - which is not very hard if you worked with Swing/AWT, Delphi, Visual Basic, Gtk, etc. What are you waiting to contribute to Krita? The developers that maintain the project answer tickets and questions posted to reddit in a good time, and are extremely easy to work with.

    <p>As I mentioned in the <a href="/2017/01/02/debugging-an-application-that-freezes-the-x-server.html">last post</a>,
