development you will work with a SME, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert>subject-matter expert</a>.
This person is someone experienced in a field such as telecom billing, insurance, taxes, or
even nature and environment.</p><p>Questions too specific, that land away from the knowledge area of software engineers,
are normally addressed by the SME. Sometimes the knowledge from a SME can be spread in a team
after they have worked together for a while.</p><p>Most of my time in New Zealand I have been working with environmental sciences. In one project,
I remember hearing other developers mention ID&rsquo;s, Keys, and Identification Keys. I had not worked
with environmental sciences before, and only learned about its Portuguese translation
(“Chave”, or “Chave de Identificação”, or “Chave
Dicotêmica”) recently.</p><p><strong>They are mechanisms, digital or physical, that help you identify plants, animals, fossils, etc.</strong>
And I found out later that there are many identification key software written for the Web, desktop,
and also other medias like PDF&rsquo;s, and even printed version.</p><p>And also in New Zealand I found how fun identifying species can be with
the <a href=https://www.inaturalist.org/>iNaturalist</a> app and community. If you are like me before, and
had not heard about it before, search around more about it. It is a very simple concept, common
to biologists, people who work with taxonomy, marine life, birds.</p><p>If you are in New Zealand, or just interested about it, here are some links to get you started identifying
the local species.</p><ul><li><a href=http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/biodiversity/biodiversity-new-zealand-resources/biodiversity-references/species/>DOC (Department of Conservation) Species descriptions and threat classifications</a></li><li><a href=http://naturewatch.org.nz/pages/links_nz>NatureWatch Helpful websites for exploring NZ nature</a></li><li><a href=https://www.niwa.co.nz/freshwater-and-estuaries/nzffd/identification-guides-and-keys>NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research) Freshwater fish ID guides/keys</a></li><li><a href=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/bbimages/PDFs/Clues2Bird%20ID.pdf>Clues to Bird ID (PDF)</a></li></ul><p>Have fun!</p><p>Categories:
