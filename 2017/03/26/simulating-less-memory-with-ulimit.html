<meta name="description" content="These days I was trying to reproduce a bug in Krita where it would crash when a user copied group layers between windows. It appeared that the user was getting a segmentation fault due to the user’s computer running out of memory. I could not reproduce the issue, but my computer has 16 GB. The first thing that came to my mind was to create a virtual machine with less memory to reproduce the issue. But I decided to spend some time looking for a simpler way of doing it. Searching the web I found some suggestions that ulimit could work. After playing for a while with ulimit and htop, and verifying the amount of memory necessary to open two files in two windows in Krita, I came up with the following settings. # 2550 mb in kb ulimit -v 2550000 # 2 gb in kb ulimit -m 2000000 # Confirm limits ulimit -a gdb $HOME/Development/cpp/workspace/krita_install/bin/krita Then after copying a few layers from one window to another, I successfully reproduced the issue, and could include a backtrace in the Krita issue tracking system. ♥ Open Source" />

    <p>These days I was trying to reproduce <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376382">a bug in Krita</a>
where it would crash when a user copied group layers between windows. It appeared that the user was
getting a segmentation fault due to the user’s computer running out of memory.</p>

<p>I could not reproduce the issue, but my computer has 16 GB. The first thing that came to my mind was
to create a virtual machine with less memory to reproduce the issue. But I decided to spend some time
looking for a <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">simpler way</a> of doing it.</p>

<p>Searching the web I found some suggestions that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ulimit</code> could work. After playing for a while with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ulimit</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">htop</code>, and verifying the amount of memory necessary to open two files in two windows
in Krita, I came up with the following settings.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># 2550 mb in kb</span>
<span class="nb">ulimit</span> <span class="nt">-v</span> 2550000

<span class="c"># 2 gb in kb</span>

<span class="nb">ulimit</span> <span class="nt">-a</span>

gdb <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/Development/cpp/workspace/krita_install/bin/krita
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then after copying a few layers from one window to another, I successfully reproduced the issue,
and could include a backtrace in the Krita issue tracking system.</p>
