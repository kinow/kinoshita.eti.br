people would spend their time troubleshooting my issues, or just educating me on how to
behave in an Open Source community, or even how I should have troubleshooted initially
the issue myself. So whenever I have time, I try to write detailed and polite replies. The
person posting the comment is my past. The person posting the comment is my future :-)
