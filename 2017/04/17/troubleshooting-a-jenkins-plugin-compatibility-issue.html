*Now we use the script-security-plugin. So we need to wrap that around the script-security-plugin's tags. Will report an issue for job-dsl-plugin, and will probably submit a pull request in the next days too. There's not much left we can change in the plug-in code for that Piotr Tempes, so I'm afraid you will have to:*

* *keep saving the job*
* *perhaps work on the fix for Job DSL if you feel like doing it (as you could probably be faster than me in submitting the PR)*
* *use an older version of the active-choices-plugin that doesn't use security-script-plugin, though you could be bitten by other old bugs*
* *write some script to replace the &lt;script&gt; tag and wrap it by the secureScript (doing what the pull request will do automatically later)*

*Sorry for not being able to quickly provide any workaround, nor to cut a quick bugfix release.*

*Cheers*
*Bruno*

ps: When I started getting involved in Open Source, I always felt extremely happy when
people would spend their time troubleshooting my issues, or just educating me on how to
behave in an Open Source community, or even how I should have troubleshooted initially
the issue myself. So whenever I have time, I try to write detailed and polite replies. The
