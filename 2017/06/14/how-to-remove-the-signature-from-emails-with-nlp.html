As Wendy mentioned, I am leading an AR/VR taskforce at Foobar Retail Solutions. The goal of the taskforce is to better understand how AR/VR can apply to retail/commerce and if/what is the role of a shopping center in AR/VR applications for retail.

Here’s what the Python code looks like. &gt;&gt;&gt; from Parser import read_email, strip, prob_block &gt;&gt;&gt; from spacy.en import English &gt;&gt;&gt; pos = English() # part-of-speech tagger &gt;&gt;&gt; msg_raw = read_email(&#39;emails/test1.txt&#39;) &gt;&gt;&gt; msg_stripped = strip(msg_raw) # preprocessing text before POS tagging # iterate through lines, write to file if not signature block &gt;&gt;&gt; generate_text(msg_stripped, .9, pos_tagger, &#39;emails/test1_clean.txt&#39;) What got me interested about this utility was the use of NLP. I couldn’t imagine how someone could use NLP for that. And I liked the simplicity of the approach, which is not perfect, but can be useful someday. After the imports in the code, it creates a Part of Speech tagger using spaCy NLP library, reads the e-mail from a file, and sripts and creates an array with each paragraph of the message. The magic happens in the generate_text function, which receives the array of paragraphs, a threshold, the POS tagger, and the output destination. Here’s what the function does. for each message if probability ( signature block | message ) &lt; threshold write to output file And the formula for calculating the probability is quite simple too. 1. For a given paragraph (message block), find all the sentences in it. 2. Then for each word (token) in the sentence, count the number of times a non-verb appears. 3. Return the proportion of non-verbs per sentence, i.e. number of non-verbs / number of sentences. In summary, it discards blocks that do not contain enough verbs to be considered a message block, being treated as signature blocks instead. Never thought about using an approach like this. It may definitely be helpful when doing data analysis, information retrieval, or scraping data from the web. Not necessarily with e-mails and signatures, but you got the gist of it. ♥ Open Source" />

<p>What got me interested about this utility was the use of NLP. I couldn’t imagine how someone could use NLP for that. And I liked the simplicity of the approach, which is not perfect, but can be useful someday.</p>

<p>After the imports in the code, it creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech">Part of Speech</a> tagger using <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> NLP library, reads the e-mail from a file, and sripts and creates an array with each paragraph of the message.</p>

<p>The magic happens in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generate_text</code> function, which receives the <strong>array of paragraphs</strong>, a <strong>threshold</strong>, the <strong>POS tagger</strong>, and the <strong>output destination</strong>. Here’s what the function does.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for each message
    if probability ( signature block | message ) &lt; threshold
        write to output file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the formula for calculating the probability is quite simple too.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. For a given paragraph (message block), find all the sentences in it.
2. Then for each word (token) in the sentence, count the number of times a non-verb appears.
3. Return the proportion of non-verbs per sentence, i.e. number of non-verbs / number of sentences.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In summary, it discards blocks that do not contain enough verbs to be considered a message block, being treated as signature blocks instead.</p>

<p>Never thought about using an approach like this. It may definitely be helpful when doing data analysis, information retrieval, or scraping data from the web. Not necessarily with e-mails and signatures, but you got the gist of it.</p>
