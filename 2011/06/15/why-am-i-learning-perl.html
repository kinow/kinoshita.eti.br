I thought it was an old programming language, very powerful, but over complicated. And what do I think of Perl now? I think it is an old programming language, very powerful, but may be complicated.</p><p>Being an old programming language does not mean that it cannot dispute with newer programming languages such as <a href=http://www.ruby-lang.org>Ruby</a>, <a title=Python href=http://www.python.org>Python</a>, <a title=Scala href=http://www.scala-lang.org>Scala</a> or <a title=Go href=http://www.golang.org>Go</a>. Actually, it means that it is old, has a plethora of examples, good documentation and a vast and supportive community (a quick note here, Perl is the programming languages with more existing modules). Larry said during his talk that Perl won&rsquo;t die, but evolve with time and have its place among other programming languages.</p><p>During my four years in <a title="Mackenzie University" href=http://www.mackenzie.br>Mackenzie University</a>, the programming language that I used the most was C, and the script programming language was Shell. After the talks in the workshop, I realized that Perl has the best of both worlds, but its programs do the same thing with less lines of code in C and it has more modules and is more powerful then Shell.</p><p>I still think Perl is complicated, but depending on who wrote the code. :-) I found some nice code in <a title=CPAN href=http://www.cpan.org>CPAN</a> to start playing with. Neat and easy to understand and modify/maintain.</p><p>I have a bunch of programs that I use to automate some tasks or simply customize my environment (turning a folder in a PHP project for <a title=Eclipse href=http://www.eclipse.org>Eclipse</a>, for instance). As I use Windows and Ubuntu, I have C programs and Batch and Shell scripts that I use in both environments. I am slowly migrating my C and Batch and Shell scripts to Perl when applicable. This will save me time compiling my C code for each OS, and will replace some scripts that were getting too long and complicated.</p><p>Perl, here we go!</p><p>Categories:
