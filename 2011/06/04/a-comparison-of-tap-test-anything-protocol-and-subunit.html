Wikipedia. Perhaps my thoughts here were biased by my proximity with TAP, however I am open to suggestions, ideas or
critics (as a proof that I am open to SubUnit, I included it to the list of 'Other test protocols' in TAP Wiki, as there
was only TST :-))</p><p>Initially I wrote this post as a draft and sent it to Max, Nick, Cesar Fernandes and to Robert Collins for
revisions (hadn't heard back from Robert, unfortunately). Later I plan sending it to the TAP
development team and for the guys responsible for the Automake GSoC TAP/SubUnit project. Then decide which protocol
stick with to develop the TAP Plug-in (or SubUnit :-)). When this analysis is finished I will write an alpha version of
this plug-in to send to the Jenkins dev-list, let me know if you would like to give it a try too. I believe that the
easiest way to spread TAP or SubUnit as the de facto standard is using it, and asking for maintainers of test frameworks
such as TestNG and JUnit to add support for these formats in theirs tools or make it the default output format.<hr><p><strong>Edit</strong></p><p>As pointed by Renormalist, some tools that generate TAP also use another kind of diagnostics for extending the
test protocol. In this approach, in the next line after a test result the first character is a '#' followed by a
message. A test result may have several comment lines with diagnostic information. The comments in this case, belong
to the test result above it. Perl Test::More module produces diagnostics in this way by default. Below you find an
example of these diagnostics.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>1..1

During this article I use TAP Plug-in to refer to the plug-in to display detailed test result, though after talking with
Max we agreed that perhaps it would be a good idea implement it in some generic manner, not specific to TAP. We also
agreed it would be good check other plug-ins like
<a href=https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/xUnit+Plugin>xUnit</a>
to see if we can extend it or use some code as basis.</p><p><sup><a name=3></a>3</sup>
Still got think more about it. Probably the images will be enclosed in the TAP Stream (or another format) Base64
encoded. Perhaps we would have to decode each attachment in the test result and display it according to its mimetype
(zips, pdf, etc). But a lightbox gallery for attachments would be awesome!</p><p><sup><a name=4></a>4</sup>
