Now, looking back, although I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with my achievements in 2011, I can see their point.
In 2010 I started working as Software Quality Engineer with Anderson Santos. He was the greatest supporter of many of my ideas, so although we stopped working together in 2011, I&amp;rsquo;m still grateful to him for all he taught, for his advices and for spending some time guiding me.
He motivated me to start giving talks, going to more conferences and contributing more actively to Open Source projects. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve given almost 10 talks, including one in Belgium Testing Days, another one in Oracle JavaOne and in March next year I will be in America for a talk in STPCON. I also missed JCertif conference in Congo due to visa problems and learned some lessons from it (so sorry Max :)

I also missed <a title=JCertif href=http://www.jcertif.com>JCertif</a> conference in Congo due to visa problems and learned some lessons from it (so sorry Max :)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also joined few Open Source projects, including <a title=TestLink href=http://www.teamst.org>TestLink</a>, <a title="Jenkins CI" href=http://www.jenkins-ci.org>Jenkins</a>, created <a title=tap4j href=http://www.tap4j.org>tap4j</a>, <a title="TestLink Java API" href=http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net>testlink-java-api</a>, Jenkins <a title="Jenkins CCM Plug-in" href=http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CCM+Plugin>CCM</a>, <a title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-in" href=http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin>TestLink</a> and <a title="Jenkins TAP Plug-in" href=http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin>TAP</a> plug-ins. Was included as contributor to <a title="Apache Functor" href=http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/functor/>Apache Functor</a> project due to some minor contributions. And what is the most important thing: I had a lot of fun doing all of this! And learned so much!</p><p>There are also the articles! About ten papers, for German, American and Brazilian computer magazines. Most of them written in English (I still have a lot to learn, I know). This helped me to achieve IELTS 7 band score few days ago!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also completed three years since I met Cibele, and probably will be a proud husband in 2012 :-) Couldn&rsquo;t have done none of these items mentioned here without her by my side. As well as friends like <a title="Cesar Fernandes" href=http://cesinha.com>Cesar Fernandes</a> and <a title="Brian Patrick Bourke Lattes" href="http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;id=S4337403&amp;tipo=completo&amp;idiomaExibicao=2">Brian P. Bourke</a>. Thanks mates!</p><p>In 2011 I jumped parachutes for the very first time, started practicing slack line, surfing, climbing, went to Europe and Africa for the first time. And I started drawing again! Even illustrated two of my articles.</p><p>Finally, I&rsquo;m founding <a title=TupiLabs href=http://www.tupilabs.com>TupiLabs</a> with Cesar Fernandes. It&rsquo;ll be a company to work and create solutions using other Open Source tools (Hadoop, Biojava, TestLink, Jenkins, Chef, Apache, etc). Although there are plenty companies like that in US and Europe, there ain&rsquo;t many here in Brazil and South American in general; yet! We are still finishing some projects to release in January 2012 together with a new TupiLabs website.</p><p>Righto so&mldr; what&rsquo;s next for 2012? Here is a list of my current projects, followed by my new year&rsquo;s resolution list for 2012.
