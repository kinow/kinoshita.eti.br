And by coincidence today I had to fix a bug in <a title="tap4j - Test Anything Protocol API for Java" href=http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/>tap4j</a> that reminded me the same thing. My <a title="Cobertura homepage" href=http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/>cobertura</a> (the coverage tool that I was using at moment) report said that my code was covered by my tests. However there was a <em>bug in the covered code</em>.</p><p>If you are curious about the code you can see this issue <a title="tap4j BUG #3165200" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=3165200&amp;group_id=351793&amp;atid=1470124">here</a>. However if you really would like to know more about code coverage, I suggest you to read this <a title="How to misuse code coverage - Brian Marick" href=http://www.exampler.com/testing-com/writings/coverage.pdf>fantastic article</a> written by Brian Marick in 99 with the title &ldquo;How to misuse code coverage&rdquo;.</p><p>I will finish this post now quoting him:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;(&mldr;) they (code coverage tools) are only helpful if they&rsquo;re used to enhance thought, not to replace it&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Cheers</p><p>Categories:
