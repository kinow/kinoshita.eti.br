Today I talked to two QA Engineers about code coverage and we all agreed that code coverage helps, but is not enough. And by coincidence today I had to fix a bug in tap4j that reminded me the same thing. My cobertura (the coverage tool that I was using at moment) report said that my code was covered by my tests.
