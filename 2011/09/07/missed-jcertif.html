Extensibility refers to the fact that using formats like xUnit (like JUnit) or TestNG XML you are limited to the XML schema. Many projects are aiming automation in different levels. Executing automated tests can lead to situations where you need to have information like the database used, JDK version, screen shots taken during some tests, exception stack traces, etc. TAP and SubUnit provide manners to extend your test result and inform to a test consumer (the tool that reads your test output) about such information.
