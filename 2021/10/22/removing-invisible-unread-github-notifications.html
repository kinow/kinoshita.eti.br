I tried changing the filters, waiting for a new notification to appear so that I could mark it as read, all hoping that icon would then change. But no matter what I tried in the GitHub UI, the icon was still there.

    <p><img src="/assets/posts/2021-10-22-removing-invisible-unread-github-notifications/notifications.png" alt="GitHub Notifications icon always-on mode" class="center-aligned" /></p>

<p>Some months ago I noticed that even after I marked all my GitHub notifications
as read, the unread icon displayed at the right top corner was still showing as
if I had unread notifications.</p>

<p>I tried changing the filters, waiting for a new notification to appear so that
I could mark it as read, all hoping that icon would then change. But no matter
what I tried in the GitHub UI, the icon was still there.</p>

<p>Then I opened a ticket with GitHub support and within a couple of days they
replied suggesting me to use their
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/activity#mark-notifications-as-read">REST API</a>
to mark notifications as read.
So if you have the same issue, try the following
<a href="https://github.com/kinow/dork-scripts/blob/master/github/mark-notifications-as-read.sh">code</a>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/activity#mark-notifications-as-read</span>
curl <span class="nt">-X</span> PUT <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-H</span> <span class="s2">"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-H</span> <span class="s2">"Authorization: token </span><span class="nv">$TOKEN_GOES_HERE</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  https://api.github.com/notifications <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s1">'{"last_read_at": "'</span><span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">date</span> <span class="s1">'+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s1">'"}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will have to create a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">token</a> and use
it in the command above. Just give it “Notifications” permission, and delete
it after you have used it.</p>
