Hello! I am Bruno Kinoshita or “kinow”, born and raised in Casa Verde,
São Paulo city, Brazil, and am a typical [Paulistano
](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paulistano#Noun "São Paulo city demonym").
I lived in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland city, Aotearoa New Zealand, for 8 years.
Currently, I live in the beautiful Barcelona, Spain.

Head on to the blog for posts about languages, writing, music, and computer
programming. Or check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/ "Link to the Portfolio section") where I upload drawings, illustrations,
paintings, and more.

In computer programming, I write code in Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP,
and a few other languages. I am interested in natural language processing,
[functional programming](https://old.reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/ "FP subreddit I created in 2012"),
linked data, reasoners, and fuzzy logic. I have worked on Windows, Unix,
Linux, Mainframe, HPC, and cloud. I am the second generation in IT. My
father, [Jorge Yoshio Kinoshita](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/G3BB-G3H/jorge-yoshio-kinoshita-1953-2019),
had a career working with mainframes at IBM.

In arts, I enjoy life drawing, editorial illustration, gouache, watercolor, pastels,
3D, data visualization, and writing. Much of the way I draw and paint was imprinted
on me by my older brother [Joe Lauviah Morbitus Mortiferus](https://www.youtube.com/user/Joelauviah666).
I use mixed media, but my favorites are charcoal, graphite, ink, and for
digital art I use Blender, ClipStudio, Krita, and GIMP.
