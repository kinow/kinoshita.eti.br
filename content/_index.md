  <p>Hello! I am Bruno P. Kinoshita or <strong>“kinow”</strong>, born and raised in
  Casa Verde, São Paulo, Brazil. A typical <i title="São Paulo city demonym">Paulistano</i>.
  I moved to <i title="Māori name for Auckland">Tāmaki Makaurau</i> Auckland,
  <i title="Māori name for New Zealand (or its North Island)">Aotearoa</i> New Zealand,
  and lived there for 8 years. I currently live with my wife, Cibele, in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

  <p>Head on to the blog for posts about languages, writing, music, arts, and computer
  programming. Or visit my portfolio where I upload drawings, illustrations, paintings,
  and more.</p>

In arts, I enjoy life drawing, editorial illustration, gouache, watercolors, pastels,
3D, UI/UX, data visualization, and writing. Much of the way I draw and paint was imprinted
on me by my late big brother [Joe Lauviah Morbitus Mortiferus](https://youtu.be/wLhsyyN7T2Q?t=14)
(he would still want to be called that way, <i>shrugs</i>).
I use mixed media, but tend to use more charcoal, graphite, and ink
for traditional arts. For digital arts I use GIMP, Krita, Blender,
ClipStudio Paint, and Inkscape.

In computer programming, I write code in Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP,
and a few other languages. I am interested in natural language processing,
[functional programming](https://old.reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/ "FP subreddit I created in 2012"),
linked data, reasoners, fuzzy logic, and all things open source. I have worked
on Windows, Unix, Linux, Mainframe, HPC, and cloud. My father,
[Jorge Yoshio Kinoshita](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/G3BB-G3H/jorge-yoshio-kinoshita-1953-2019),
had a career working with mainframes at IBM.
