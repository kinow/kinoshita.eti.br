Each drawing and illustration below was drawn by hand using any combination of
charcoal, coated graphite sticks, mechanical pencils, traditional
pencils, ballpoint pens, ink pens, gouache, watercolors, colored pencils,
pastels, or markers. Some were created or altered digitally using GIMP, Krita,
Blender, ClipStudio Paint, or Inkscape.

Images are aligned horizontally, side-by-side. Use the scroll-bar or touch screen.

Some images above were commissioned for commercial use. Get in touch if
you would like to use my work, or to talk about commissions for editorial
illustration, graphic design, research and academic work, or for data
visualization.
