note: 'The Catacombs of Paris (French: Catacombes de Paris) are underground ossuaries
  in Paris, France, which hold the remains of more than six million people in a small
  part of a tunnel network built to consolidate Paris'' ancient stone mines. Extending
  south from the Barri√®re d''Enfer ("Gate of Hell") former city gate, this ossuary
  was created as part of the effort to eliminate the city''s overflowing cemeteries.'
