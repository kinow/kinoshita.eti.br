note: The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is an American supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, twin-tail,
  variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft. It was the first such U.S. jet fighter with
  twin tails. The Tomcat was developed for the United States Navy's Naval Fighter
  Experimental (VFX) program after the collapse of the F-111B project. The F-14 was
  the first of the American Teen Series fighters, which were designed incorporating
  air combat experience against MiG fighters during the Vietnam War.
