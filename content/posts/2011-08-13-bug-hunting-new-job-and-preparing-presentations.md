title: Bug hunting, new job and preparing presentations
---

It's been a while since the last time I posted something here. The reason is that I have been busy fixing bugs in <a title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin">Jenkins TestLink Plug-in</a>, <a title="TestLink" href="http://www.teamst.org">TestLink</a>, <a title="TestLink Java API" href="http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/">TestLink Java API</a>, <a title="tap4j" href="http://www.tap4j.org">tap4j</a>, <a title="Jenkins TAP Plug-in" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin">Jenkins TAP Plug-in</a> and other Open Source projects.

Recently I left <a title="Sysmap Solutions" href="http://www.sysmap.com.br">Sysmap Solutions</a>, where I was a consultant, to have my labor card signed by <a title="Lojas Riachuelo" href="http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br">Lojas Riachuelo</a>, a famous Brazilian fashion retailer (like C&amp;A, Zara, H&amp;M and so on), part of Guararapes group.

So I am still getting used to the new routine, new systems and be a employee rather than a consultant.

There are also two talks to come, one in a few days at <a title="The Developers Conferecen" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">TDC</a> (The Developers Conference) 2011 in Florian&oacute;polis, and another one in the beginning of September at <a title="JCertif" href="http://www.jcertif.com">JCertif</a> in Congo/Brazzaville. While I already bought the tickets and booked the hotel rooms, I still have to finish some slides and practical examples for both events.

I already have two draft posts that I am still writing. One about continuous integration and parallelism/concurrency, and another one about spell check in DocBook projects, specially if you are using Maven.

Today I had a new idea for a bioinformatics tool that is may be helpful for researchers and bioinformatics professionals. I will write about it as soon as I find some spare time, so stay tuned ;)

Time to get back to work!

Cheers
