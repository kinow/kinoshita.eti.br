title: Science books and articles from Zinsser's "On Writing Well" book
---

["On Writing Well"](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548)
is a book by [William Zinsser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser), published for the first time in 1976 but
already past its seventeenth edition. It is extremely well written - as it was expected
for a book with such title - and also funny and simple to read.

The book is full of excerpts and quotes from other books and articles, used as good or bad examples.
In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists
books and articles on the topic that were well written.

This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition,
except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked
interesting, so I decided to include it anyway.

>Sir Peter Brian Medawar OM CBE FRS (28 February 1915 – 2 October 1987) was a Brazilian-born British biologist, whose work on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired immune tolerance was fundamental to the practice of tissue and organ transplants. For his works in immunology he is regarded as the "father of transplantation". He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as "the wittiest of all scientific writers", and Stephen Jay Gould as "the cleverest man I have ever known".

He was also one of the most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation. Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1996, Gould was hired as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University, where he divided his time teaching there and at Harvard.
