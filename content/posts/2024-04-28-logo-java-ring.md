I created this logo sometime ago for the Java community
of a friend: https://twitter.com/java_ring

{{< showimage image="java-ring-logo.png" caption="Java Ring logo" class="feature" >}}

Acquired a license for the logo, got a copy of Duke in SVG, and
some quick Inkscape-ing to slice paths and re-order them.
