title: Article about metrics and code analysis published
---

I wrote an article about a quality analysis job done for a client of <a title="Sysmap Solutions" href="http://www.sysmap.com.br">Sysmap Solutions</a> and it was published by <a title="Testing Experience" href="http://www.testingexperience.com">TestingExperience</a> Magazine on its issue of September, number 11.

You can check the full article in TestingExperience site. It is available in PDF format for members, the registration if free though.
