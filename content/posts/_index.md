<h1 aria-hidden="true" class="hidden">Blog</h1>

This blog started with posts only about computer programming. But over the
years I started posting drawings and illustrations, maps and GIS images,
writing about arts and, more recently, about data visualization.
I also keep some [technical notes][notes] and [gists] on GitHub.

Main topics: [Open Source][opensource], [Workflows][workflows], [Arts][arts]
<!-- [UIUX][uiux], [Accessibility][accessibility] -->
