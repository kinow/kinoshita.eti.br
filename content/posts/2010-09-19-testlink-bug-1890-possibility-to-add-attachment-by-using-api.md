title: 'TestLink BUG-1890: Possibility to add attachment by using API'
---

With the help of <a title="Francisco Mancardi's Linkedin." href="http://it.linkedin.com/pub/francisco-mancardi/18/441/2b9">Francisco Mancardi</a> I wrote a code that was merged into the <a title="TestLink" href="http://www.teamst.org/">TestLink</a> repository trunk. Now you're going to be able to upload attachments such as, for instance, test evidences to your TestLink :-). I hope you like it.

I decided to contribute with this code because I needed something similar for the <a title="TestLink Hudson Plug-In" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/TestLink+Plugin">TestLink Hudson plug-in</a>. Hopefully the plug-in new version will be released before October.

Cheers
