title: Creating a logo in Inkscape - process
---

This weekend I spent some computer time not writing or reading code,
but actually toying around with Inkscape to create a logo. While it
created using very simple operations in Inkscape, it took me quite
a while to remember the shortcuts and how to merge objects.

This logo is not actually used. It was an entry to a call for proposals.

### The Process

This post won't have much text. It will be more screen shots of the
process with short commentaire.

### And a bug

During the step of making the text fancier, when I tried to add a ribbon with
text and the bend effect, when moving the ribbon grouped with the text and after
saving the file, the text changed in some strange way.

Now just need to finish reading
[how to report bugs to the Inkscape project](https://inkscape.org/contribute/report-bugs/)
to send it to the developers.
