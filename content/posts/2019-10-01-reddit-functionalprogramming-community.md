[r/functionalprogramming](https://reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/) was created nearly seven years ago.
It started when I was interested in contributing to
[Apache Commons Functor](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-functor/).

I created it to have a place to collect links about functional programming. To my surprise there was
no subreddit for functional programming. So I created one. Fast forward a few years, the community is
still active, with a healthy group of nearly 10.000 readers and contributors.

Nowadays I spend something like 5 to 20 minutes everyday moderating posts. And a little more than that whenever I
find some interesting post to read. But if I could change one thing in the community, it would be to find
more moderators.

It is a huge responsibility to be the sole moderator of content read by thousands of readers.
Whilst I try to stay neutral, and keep it a healthy community, I feel like having other
people with different background and opinions would be good for the future of the community.
