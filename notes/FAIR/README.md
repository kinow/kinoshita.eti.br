“Challenges remain: provenance standards have yet to be fully embraced by WfMS,
there are still shortages of provenance processing tools. Automated provenance
collection can be too fine-grained and too detailed to be of service to researchers,
indicating a need for ontological abstractions. So, **the computational steps
are themselves unFAIR**.”
