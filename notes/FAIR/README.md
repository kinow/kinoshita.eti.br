“Challenges remain: provenance standards have yet to be fully embraced by WfMS,
there are still shortages of provenance processing tools. Automated provenance
collection can be too fine-grained and too detailed to be of service to researchers,
indicating a need for ontological abstractions. So, **the computational steps
are themselves unFAIR**. Although open source tools allow us to inspect procedures,
many codes are proprietary software or opaque boxes (...) that **do not disclose the
link between their inputs and outputs**, breaking the provenance lineage of data.
Steps in coarse-grained workflows are often wrapped applications with buried sub-
-workflows and manual (not tracked) steps within. Data resources and tools do not
always report basic metadata such as their version or license in a standardised,
machine interpretable way.”
