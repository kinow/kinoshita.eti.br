# Coarse-grained and fine-grained

“WfMS can roughly be divided into two types, namely coarse-grained,
with a prime focus on chaining locally hosted or distributed tools
(e.g. Galaxy, KNIME, Taverna) and fine-grained focusing on optimising
computational resources over Distributed Computing Infrastructures
(DCI) or High Performance Computing (HPC) for applications (e.g.
Pegasus, SnakeMake, Nextflow, Dispel4Py) and cloud-based container
orchestration (Kubernetes). Many WfMS mix the two kinds. All WfMS
aim to handle common cross-cutting concerns on behalf of the workflow
execution.”
