    <p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/2014/10/11/basic-workflow-of-a-sparql-query-in-fuseki">previous post</a>, 
I am using <a href="http://jena.apache.org">Apache Jena</a> for a project of a customer. I had never used 
any triple store, nor a SPARQL Endpoint server before. But for being involved with the Apache 
Software Foundation, and since the company itself is using several Apache components, it was only 
natural Jena to be our first choice.</p>
<p>It has served us very well so far. At the moment we have less than 100 queries per day, but the 
project is still under development and we expect 1000 queries per day by the first quarter of 
2015 and 1000000 near the end of 2015. We also have few entries in TDB, but expect to grow this 
number to a few million before 2016.</p>
<p>When I work for companies and we use Open Source Software (OSS) in a project, I always 
prepare assessment reports to include in the deliveries. In this report I justify the choice 
of Open Source Software (as well as commercial software). Sometimes I 
am lucky to work for a company that asks me to include hours to work on OSS :-)</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> to triage issues in OSS projects (and for several other 
things). I have a board with several cards for Open Source. About a month ago I set up one 
for Jena and listed the issues that I thought I could contribute to. </p>
<div class='row'>

</a>
<figcaption>Jena Trello card</i></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>I annotate easy issues with a &#8220;lhf&#8221; suffix for Low Hanging Fruit issues, and delete issues from 
the card once I submit a patch or update it (and include it in another card for the 
<a href="https://tupilabs.github.io/tag/tupilabs-report/">TupiLabs reports</a>).</p>
<p>Most of the issues I included in the card for Jena had been created over two years ago, and hadn&#8217;t 
been updated in a while. When you test these issues against the current code, usually you find that 
some of them have already been fixed. Other issues included documentation problems, and minor features. I didn&#8217;t find any blocker issue that would impede us to use Jena in production.</p>

</div>

<p>The picture above shows the past 30 days activity summary in JIRA for Jena. The red line shows 
issues created, and the green line issues resolved. <a href="https://github.com/afs">Andy Seaborne</a> 
was very active in the past days and fixed several issues that were too old and had already been fixed in the trunk, and kindly merged patches and pull requests.</p>
<p>Some issues like <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-632">JENA-632</a> will take a 
longer time to fix, but I&#8217;m getting used to Jena&#8217;s source code, and at the same getting more 
confident to use it in production - especially with a supportive OSS community. We are using 
Jena for RDF with Hadoop, and I learned that I can replace some custom Writables by others 
in the Jena Hadoop submodule.</p>
<p>By the way, even though this project ends in April, I intend to continue contributing to Jena. 
There is a lot of parts of the code that I would love to be able to understand and contribute, 
in special the Graph database, optimization techniques for SPARQL queries, the grammars used 
in the project, Fuseki v2 and enhance its testing harness (as well as the test coverage).</p>
<p><strong>If you are looking for a interesting project to get you started with semantics, linked data, 
RDF, and even graphs and database querying, try contributing to Jena. I bet you&#8217;ll have a lot 
of fun!</strong></p>
<p>Happy hacking and happy 2015!</p><!-- html -->

    <p><a href="http://rosalind.info">Rosalind</a> is a website with a curated set of exercices for bioinformatics, organized hierarchily. 
In some of these examples you are required to replace characters (nucleotides) by other characters. It is a rather common 
task for developers, like when you need to replace special characters in user&#8217;s names.</p>
<p>There are different ways of describing it, such as translate, replace, or <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration">transliterate</a></strong>. The latter being my favorite definition. </p>
<p>In Python I know that there are several different ways of transliterating strings 
[<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transliterate">1</a>][<a href="http://blog.lebowtech.com/blog/programming/python/transliterate-with-python.html">2</a>]. But in Java I always ended up using a Map or a Enum and writing my own method in some <em>Util</em> class for that.</p>
<p>Turns out that <a href="http://commons.apache.org">Apache Commons Lang</a>, which I use in most of my projects, 
provided this feature. What means that I will be able to reduce the length of my code, what also means 
less code to be tested (and one less place to look for bugs).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">replaceChars</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ATGCATGC&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;GTCA&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;CAGT&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// &quot;TACGTACG&quot;</span>
<span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>What the code above does, is replace G by C, T by A, C by G and A by T. This process is part of finding the 
<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html">DNA reverse complement</a>. But you can also use this for replacing 
special characters, spaces by _, and so it goes.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p><!-- html -->

<a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://kinoshita.eti.br/2013/09/29/the-apache-way-and-on-writing-software-reviews" data-text="The Apache Way and on writing software reviews" data-via="kinow" data-hashtags="opensource">Tweet</a>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">Apache Way</a> is the philosophy behind 
Apache Software Foundation and is shared by all of its projects. It is composed by a set of principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative software development</li>
<li>Commercial-friendly standard license</li>
<li>Consistently high quality software</li>
<li><strong>Respectful, honest, technical-based interaction</strong></li>
<li>Faithful implementation of standards</li>
<li>Security as a mandatory feature</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been part of <a href="http://commons.apache.org">Apache Commons</a> for a while, and haven&#8217;t 
really contributed much yet. Maybe because I had lots of projects related to 
<a href="http://tupilabs.com">TupiLabs</a> as well as my own wedding this year. But I can 
assure that <em>respectful, honest, technical-based interaction</em> is quite right (not to discredit the 
other items, of course).</p>
<p>Even though there are critics of the Apache Way (<a href="" title="#1">1</a>, <a href="" title="#2">2</a>, <a href="" title="#3">3</a>), it still stands as an important 
pillar for the Apache Software Foundation, and its principles help to create stable and 
production ready software, such as <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Apache Hadoop</a>, 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache Httpd</a>, <a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang">Apache Commons Lang</a>, 
among <a href="http://projects.apache.org">others</a>.</p>
<p>There are many reviews and comparisons on Apache software (as well as on 
other software, like JavaScript libraries, Java Web Frameworks, Ruby Web servers and so on). 
Sometimes, though, these reviews or comparisons can be biased or not well founded. In 
cases like this, the developers of the tools may be frustrated, or users can be 
misled and choose the software based on wrong assertions.</p>
<p>I have just returned from honey moon, ready to start writing code again, but 
first I had to read all the unread messages in my inbox. Some were e-mails from <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html">Apache 
mailing lists</a>. <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/uoh5m55mh4qjybaw">One of these e-mails</a> 
had Phil Steitz comments on a post by Daniel Wu. </p>
<p>Instead of publishing his performance benchmark results of 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/pool">Apache Commons Pool</a>, Daniel posted his 
code to the commons-dev mailing list. Phil Steitz, one of Apache Commons Pool 
committers replied with questions and a few points that Daniel could use to 
enrich his benchmark tests.</p>
<p>This kind of behavior happens a lot within Apache (at least in the mailing lists that 
I follow), and it produces a lot of benefits for different parts. </p>
<ul>
<li>The person writing a review or comparison can get the programmer opinion before actually 
publishing anything. </li>
<li>The programmer can see how other people were testing his/her code.</li>
<li>All other commons-pool committers and maintainers, the mailing list readers, and 
people that found the mailing list archives will be able to read the conversation 
history.</li>
<li>No misguided benchmark results were published (and lots of wrong decisions were avoided).</li>
</ul>
<p>I keep loving the Apache Way and the resulting community and code around it. There are 
always lots of things to learn, the Open Source projects communities are healthy and you will always find 
people willing to share their experience and time teaching you.</p>

    <p>Last year I became an <a href="http://www.apache.org" title="Apache">Apache</a> committer, and dedicated most of my time learning the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/learn/theapacheway.html" title="The Apache Way">Apache way</a>, reading different mailing lists and getting used to the things a committer is supposed to know (voting process, keeping everything in the mailing list, and so it goes) and getting used to <a href="http://commons.apache.org/functor" title="Apache Commons Functor">[functor]</a> API.</p>

<p>In 2013 I hope I can help in the release of [functor], since Java and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming">functional programming</a> are getting a lot more of attention recently, probably due to the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/" title="Project Lambda">project lambda</a>. But I also want to start contributing with the other components from commons (like <a href="http://commons.apache.org/math/" title="Apache Commons Math">math</a>, <a href="http://commons.apache.org/io/" title="Apache Commons IO">io</a>, <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jcs/" title="Apache Commons JCS">jcs</a>) and other top level projects (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" title="Apache Hadoop">hadoop</a>, <a href="http://nutch.apache.org/" title="Apache Nutch">nutch</a>, <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" title="Apache Lucene">lucene</a>).</p>

<h4>Reviewing SVN commits log</h4>

<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FUNCTOR-14" title="Apache Commons Functor - Issue 14">FUNCTOR-14</a> was created to enhance the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/functor/apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/generator/package-summary.html">generators API</a> in [functor]. I&#8217;d worked on <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/functor/branches/generators-FUNCTOR-14/">a branch</a> for this issue, but needed some review in order to be able to merge it with the trunk. That&#8217;s where you can see why Open Source is so awesome. Another Apache member, Matt Benson, created <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/functor/branches/FUNCTOR-14-mm/">another branch</a> to work on the project structure, but also to review the generator API.</p>

    <p><a href='http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/functor/'>Apache Commons Functor</a> (hereon [functor]) is an <a href='http://commons.apache.org/'>Apache Commons</a> component that provides a functional programming API and several patterns implemented (visitor, generator, aggregator, etc). <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/" title="Java 8 lambda">Java 8</a> has several nice new features, including lambda expressions and <a href="http://datumedge.blogspot.com.br/2012/06/java-8-lambdas.html">functional interfaces</a>. In Java 8, lambdas or lambdas expressions are <a href="http://tronicek.blogspot.com.br/2007/12/closures-closure-is-form-of-anonymous_28.html">closures</a> that can be evaluated and behave like anonymous methods.</p>

<p>Functional interfaces are interfaces with only one method. These interfaces can be used in lambdas and save you a lot of time from writing anonymous classes or even implementing the interfaces. [functor] provides several functional interfaces (thanks to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FUNCTOR-20">Matt Benson</a>). It hasn&#8217;t been released yet, but there are some new examples in the project site, in the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/functor/trunk/" title="[functor] SVN trunk">trunk of the SVN</a>. I will use one of these examples to show how [functor] functional interfaces can be used in conjunction with Java 8 lambdas.</p>

<p>After the example with [functor] in Java 8, I will explain how I am running Java 8 in Eclipse (it&#8217;s kind of a <a href="http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com/expression/define?e=Gambiarra" title="Gambiarra">gambiarra</a>, but works well).</p>
