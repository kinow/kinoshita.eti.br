With
a simple Japanese, still hard to understand his jokes, but luckily most of his videos were
translated to Portuguese or English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He passed away a few days ago, so I looked for some of his old videos to remember him.
&amp;ldquo;Jailbreak&amp;rdquo; (脱獄物語) is a story about jailed Shimura. His daughter visits him in jail,
and after the guard leaves, Drift Ken starts explaining to his daughter his escape plan.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
