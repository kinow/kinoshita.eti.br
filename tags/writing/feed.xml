This is an expression that has the same meaning as piece of cake, meaning that something is very easy.
From the comments in that thread, there are more examples.
In English &amp;quot;&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; for breakfast&amp;quot; means that something is very easy.
I eat punks like you for breakfast
In Chinese &amp;ldquo;小菜一碟&amp;rdquo; (xiao3 cai4 yi4 die2) translates to &amp;ldquo;a plate of small dish&amp;rdquo;, and has the same meaning.</description></item><item><title>The etymology of bombast</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</guid><description>On &amp;ldquo;On Writing Well&amp;rdquo;, Zinsser wrote:
&amp;ldquo;There is a deep yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast.&amp;rdquo;
I thought &amp;ldquo;bombast&amp;rdquo; would be related to the Portuguese word &amp;ldquo;bombástico&amp;rdquo;, which can mean something like fantastic, amazing.
Turns out it has a different meaning. Google defines it as:
high-sounding language with little meaning, used to impress people.
But it also an interesting etymology.
1570s, &amp;ldquo;cotton padding,&amp;rdquo; corrupted from earlier bombace &amp;ldquo;raw cotton&amp;rdquo; (1550s), from Old French bombace &amp;ldquo;cotton, cotton wadding,&amp;rdquo; from Late Latin bombacem, accusative of bombax &amp;ldquo;cotton, &amp;rsquo;linteorum aut aliae quaevis quisquiliae,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; a corruption and transferred use of Latin bombyx &amp;ldquo;silk,&amp;rdquo; from Greek bombyx &amp;ldquo;silk, silkworm&amp;rdquo; (which also came to mean &amp;ldquo;cotton&amp;rdquo; in Medieval Greek), from some oriental word, perhaps related to Iranian pambak (modern panba) or Armenian bambok, perhaps ultimately from a PIE root meaning &amp;ldquo;to twist, wind.</description></item><item><title>Science books and articles from Zinsser's "On Writing Well" book</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/01/02/science-books-and-articles-from-zinssers-on-writing-well-book.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/01/02/science-books-and-articles-from-zinssers-on-writing-well-book.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548">&amp;ldquo;On Writing Well&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>
is a book by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser">William Zinsser&lt;/a>, published for the first time in 1976 but
already past its seventeenth edition. It is extremely well written - as it was expected
for a book with such title - and also funny and simple to read.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;p>The book is full of excerpts and quotes from other books and articles, used as good or bad examples.
In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists
books and articles on the topic that were well written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition,
except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked
interesting, so I decided to include it anyway.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
