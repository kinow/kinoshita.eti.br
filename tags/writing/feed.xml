This is an expression that has the same meaning as piece of cake, meaning that something is very easy.
From the comments in that thread, there are more examples.
In English &amp;quot;&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; for breakfast&amp;quot; means that something is very easy.
I eat punks like you for breakfast</description></item><item><title>The etymology of bombast</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>[email protected] (Bruno P.

&amp;ldquo;There is a deep yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast.&amp;rdquo;
I thought &amp;ldquo;bombast&amp;rdquo; would be related to the Portuguese word &amp;ldquo;bombástico&amp;rdquo;, which can mean something like fantastic, amazing.
Turns out it has a different meaning. Google defines it as:
high-sounding language with little meaning, used to impress people.
But it also an interesting etymology.</description></item><item><title>Science books and articles from Zinsser's "On Writing Well" book</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/01/02/science-books-and-articles-from-zinssers-on-writing-well-book.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>[email protected] (Bruno P.

is a book by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser">William Zinsser&lt;/a>, published for the first time in 1976 but
already past its seventeenth edition. It is extremely well written - as it was expected
for a book with such title - and also funny and simple to read.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;p>The book is full of excerpts and quotes from other books and articles, used as good or bad examples.
In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists
books and articles on the topic that were well written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition,
except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked
interesting, so I decided to include it anyway.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
