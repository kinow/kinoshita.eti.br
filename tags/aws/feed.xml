That&amp;rsquo;s the case for Google Storage, Google Vision, and for Google Natural Language API&amp;rsquo;s.
I recently had to use the latter in a POC at work, and ran into an interesting issue with our AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Google Language API requires that clients authenticate before sending requests. If you use their google-cloud-java, you can define the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.</description></item><item><title>Using AWS MFA without a mobile phone</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/02/28/using-aws-mfa-without-a-mobile-phone.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/02/28/using-aws-mfa-without-a-mobile-phone.html</guid><description>If you use AWS, the chances are that you use MFA - Multi-factor Authentication - to authenticate. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to install apps in my mobile phone, unless I need to, so having bought a new phone recently, I decided to find a replacement for Google Authenticator.
There are several command line utilities, browser extensions, libraries, and tools (free and paid) that implement the TOTP - time-based one-time password -, the standard required by Amazon for MFA authentication.</description></item><item><title>Using the AWS API with Python</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2016/10/04/using-the-aws-api-with-python.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2016/10/04/using-the-aws-api-with-python.html</guid><description>Amazon Web Services provides a series of cloud services. When you access the web interface, most - if not all - of the actions you do there are actually translated into API calls.
They also provide SDK&amp;rsquo;s in several programming languages. With these SDK&amp;rsquo;s you are able to call the same API used by the web interface. Python has boto (or boto3) which lets you to automate several tasks in AWS.</description></item></channel></rss>
