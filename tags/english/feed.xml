This is an expression that has the same meaning as piece of cake, meaning that something is very easy.
From the comments in that thread, there are more examples.
In English &amp;quot;&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; for breakfast&amp;quot; means that something is very easy.
I eat punks like you for breakfast</description></item><item><title>The etymology of bombast</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>[email protected] (Bruno P.

&amp;ldquo;There is a deep yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast.&amp;rdquo;
I thought &amp;ldquo;bombast&amp;rdquo; would be related to the Portuguese word &amp;ldquo;bombástico&amp;rdquo;, which can mean something like fantastic, amazing.
Turns out it has a different meaning. Google defines it as:
high-sounding language with little meaning, used to impress people.
But it also an interesting etymology.</description></item></channel></rss>
