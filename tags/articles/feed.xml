It is a conference on pattern languages of programming. About six months ago I saw a tweet by Eduardo Guerra asking if anyone had some cases where certain patterns were applied.

In this article Cesar Fernandes de Almeida, Anderson dos Santos and I discuss how to make your Java tests output TAP (Test Anything Protocol) Streams.

In this article you will find a short tutorial to set up a TestNG test and a simple Job to execute your automated tests. Now we are writing a docbook document to explain with more details how the plug-in works and how you can play with it. We are also working in more samples, translation and video demos.</description></item><item><title>Article about TestLink and Hudson integration published</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2010/12/10/article-about-testlink-and-hudson-integration-published.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2010/12/10/article-about-testlink-and-hudson-integration-published.html</guid><description>Since September I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project to integrate TestLink and Hudson. The project consists basically in a Hudson Plug-in that uses TestLink Java API to retrieve information of Automated Test Cases created in TestLink. You can read more about the plug-in in the following address: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/TestLink+Plugin.
I wrote an article in conjunction with Anderson dos Santos about this Plug-in. The article was published by Testing Experience in its December issue.</description></item><item><title>Article about metrics and code analysis published</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2010/09/03/article-about-metrics-and-code-analysis-published.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2010/09/03/article-about-metrics-and-code-analysis-published.html</guid><description>I wrote an article about a quality analysis job done for a client of Sysmap Solutions and it was published by TestingExperience Magazine on its issue of September, number 11.
