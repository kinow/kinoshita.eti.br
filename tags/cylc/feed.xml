Cylc and StackStorm. I won&amp;rsquo;t enter into details about these two tools, but I must note that I worked on Cylc during my employment with NIWA, in New Zealand.
In this post I will only show a very simple workflow called five first using Cylc, and then the same workflow with StackStorm.
Cylc First let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the source code of this workflow with Cylc 8 and plot it.</description></item><item><title>NZRSE 2020 Cylc UI Scalability</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/09/03/nzrse-2020-cylc-ui-scalability.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/09/03/nzrse-2020-cylc-ui-scalability.html</guid><description>Lightning talk for the NZRSE 2020 conference.</description></item><item><title>Using Lumino with Vue</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/03/28/using-lumino-with-vue.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/03/28/using-lumino-with-vue.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino">Lumino&lt;/a> is the engine that powers the GUI of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/">JupyterLab&lt;/a>. It used to be called Phosphor JS,
but some time ago there was a misunderstanding and the author gave up maintaining it.
Then JupyterLab decided to fork it under this new name.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The documentation is still lacking, but it works as expected, and there is already a
community supporting it. We decided to use it in &lt;a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui">Cylc UI&lt;/a>
to have tabbed panels like JupyterLab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/kinow/vue-lumino">This project&lt;/a> contains the part of the code of
Cylc UI that integrated Lumino and Vue. It was a suggestion from one of the maintainers
of JupyterLab, that got involved in an issue of Cylc UI. You can find this project linked
too in the Lumino project &lt;code>README&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experimenting with Vuejs and Cytoscape</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/11/19/experimenting-with-vuejs-and-cytoscape.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/11/19/experimenting-with-vuejs-and-cytoscape.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The project I work on at work had a GUI interface with Python and PyGTK, which is now being

&lt;a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui">on GitHub&lt;/a> licensed under GPLv3.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first library we decided to try is Cytoscape, a well-known graph library, with use cases
in research, corporate, and other fields. One limitation of Cytoscape is that the way it renders
the graph nodes is limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Limited, meaning that you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to easily add HTML, images, SVG, animation, etc. Though
not impossible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cylc videos</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/09/22/cylc-videos.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/09/22/cylc-videos.html</guid><description>Last week I put together a playlist with all Cylc videos I could found on Youtube.

&lt;p>There are tools out there that can be used to reverse engineer databases and generate diagrams. These tools
normally are GUI based. But &lt;a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc-doc/pull/29">I needed&lt;/a> one that could be used in a
project build to generate a simple diagram for documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A tool in Python would be ideal, as that is the language the project I was working on was written in. After
searching in DuckDuckGo and PYPI, I found &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/ERAlchemy/">ERAlchemy&lt;/a> that
seemed to have the features I needed - kinda.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A look at the first implementation of GraphQL in Cylc</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/05/17/a-look-at-the-first-implementation-of-graphql-in-cylc.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/05/17/a-look-at-the-first-implementation-of-graphql-in-cylc.html</guid><description>&lt;figure class="feature">

&lt;p>For Cylc 8 we are adding an initial implementation of GraphQL, to replace the previous REST API.
Besides the technologies in the API&amp;rsquo;s, another difference is that for the REST API, its main
consumer was a PyGTK GUI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new GraphQL API, on the other hand, will be used mainly by a Vue.js Web application. So a
few things need to be done in a different way due to the jump from Desktop GUI to Web GUI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Cylc tasks on PBS Torque with Docker</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/12/22/running-cylc-tasks-on-pbs-torque-with-docker.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/12/22/running-cylc-tasks-on-pbs-torque-with-docker.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days ago I saw &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cylc/dP2I1Gxqi20">a post&lt;/a> at the
Cylc Google Group, about file permissions for files generated by Cylc. The post was related to
content created by Cylc, but in an environment with PBS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context, Cylc is an Open Source meta-scheduler, written in Python, that allows you to
define cycle points with dependencies. These cycle points can be simple incremental integer
numbers, or ISO8601 periods or points (e.g. run every 5 minutes, from 10 days ago until the
next year). Cylc takes care to create an execution schedule for you, and delegate that to a
system that runs your workflow. I work full time on this amazing Open Source tool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such system could be the local computer in background, batch systems such as &lt;code>at&lt;/code>, or PBS.
PBS was created for NASA, to manage executing jobs taking into consideration cluster resources,
and also using queues, priorities, and other features useful for HPC programming. Later PBS
was acquired by Altair, an Open Source version OpenPBS was created, and later abandoned. And
there is another fork called PBS Torque. I first encountered PBS at the São Paulo
University, in Brazil, where they had a &lt;a href="http://www.usp.br/hpc/puma.php">PBS Torque cluster&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="running-pbs-torque-with-docker">Running PBS Torque with Docker&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Even though I have access to an environment with Cylc and with PBS, I decided to give it a try
and see how hard it would be to reproduce it with Docker. One thing that I like about this
approach is the possibility to share the work with others online. I believe it improves
communication, agility, and can be useful for posterity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A couple of class diagrams of JupyterHub</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/10/06/a-couple-of-class-diagrams-of-jupyterhub.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/10/06/a-couple-of-class-diagrams-of-jupyterhub.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Started on a new project last Monday.
