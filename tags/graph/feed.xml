ported to the web. We have adopted Vuejs as the JS framework, and have been building the
components required for our UI over the past months. The project is hosted
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui">on GitHub&lt;/a> licensed under GPLv3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Cylc 7, an important visualization was the workflow graph. The screenshot below is from
the design sketches done by another contributor from the UK, showing how it should look in
Cylc 8.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first library we decided to try is Cytoscape, a well-known graph library, with use cases
in research, corporate, and other fields. One limitation of Cytoscape is that the way it renders
the graph nodes is limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Limited, meaning that you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to easily add HTML, images, SVG, animation, etc. Though
not impossible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
