was about what happens when you upload a Turtle file to Apache Jena Fuseki. And now today&amp;rsquo;s post will be about
what happens when you create a new dataset in Apache Jena Fuseki.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, that happens before you upload a Turtle file, but this post series won&amp;rsquo;t follow a logical order.
It will be more based on what I find interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, the dataset created is &lt;strong>an in-memory dataset&lt;/strong>. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simplified sequence diagram. Again,
these articles are more brain-dumps, used by myself for later reference.&lt;/p>

Even though it has been three years since that pull request, there are still many parts of the project code base that I am not familiar with.
And not only the code, but there are also many concepts about SPARQL, other standards used in Jena, and internals about triple stores.</description></item><item><title>Basic workflow of a SPARQL query in Fuseki</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2014/10/11/basic-workflow-of-a-sparql-query-in-fuseki.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2014/10/11/basic-workflow-of-a-sparql-query-in-fuseki.html</guid><description>Before using any library or tool in a customer project, specially when it is an Open Source one, there are many things that I like to look at before deploying it. Basically, I look at the features, documentation, community, open issues (in special blockers or criticals), the time to release fixes and new features and, obviously, the license.
At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m using Apache Jena to work with ontologies, SPARQL and data matching and enrichment for a customer.</description></item></channel></rss>
