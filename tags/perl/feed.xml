For being a Java programmer, you can imagine how lost I was feeling there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first programming language that I had contact with was Perl. I was a 16 years old &lt;a title="Slackware Linux" href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware&lt;/a> aficionado at that time, and was dying to have a web site with a guestbook . We did not have any cheap hosting services in Brazil that offered a &lt;a title="PHP" href="http://www.php.net">PHP&lt;/a> environment, but there were few companies that offered a free host with ads, and with Perl. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember which script I used, only that I found it in &lt;a title="HotScripts.com" href="http://www.hotscripts.com">HotScripts.com&lt;/a> and that it stored the guestbook entries in disk. Now, ten years after, here I am playing with Perl again! :-D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well, what was my idea of Perl before the event? I thought it was an old programming language, very powerful, but over complicated. And what do I think of Perl now? I think it is an old programming language, very powerful, but may be complicated.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
