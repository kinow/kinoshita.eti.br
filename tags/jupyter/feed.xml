It is used by DevOps but also by researchers in industry and academia. Some days ago I ran an experiment where I tried to reproduce similar behaviour of the plug-in with Jupyter Notebooks and ipywidgets.
The experiment was a success, and I am convinced one could achieve the same in Jupyter Notebooks. Jenkins could be used as workflow manager, or the parameters could be submitted to a different workflow manager or another system.</description></item></channel></rss>
