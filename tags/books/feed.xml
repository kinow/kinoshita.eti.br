I really miss the Livraria Cultura at Avenida Paulista, or the Saraiva Megastores. Whitcoulls and Paper Plus do a good job, but they have very few series, only recent releases, and you do not feel that cool environment while you browse the books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found that small secondhand bookstores are the best places to find good books - not only science fiction - in New Zealand. Devonport has one, near the waterfront. Auckland has Jason books too, right in the CBD. Wellington, Dunedin and Queenstown too (the Queenstown one is on the second level in a small mall, you have to check it out!).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
