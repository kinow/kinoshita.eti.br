QLayout: Attempting to add QLayout &amp;quot;&amp;quot; to QWidget &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;, which already has a layout
Krita recently announced the release of 3.1.3-alpha-2, and while testing I saw this warning and decided to investigate why this warning happens.
There was already a similar question posted on StackOverflow. And the best answer&amp;rsquo;s initial paragraph gave me a hint of what to look for.</description></item><item><title>Simulating less memory with ulimit</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/03/26/simulating-less-memory-with-ulimit.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/03/26/simulating-less-memory-with-ulimit.html</guid><description>These days I was trying to reproduce a bug in Krita where it would crash when a user copied group layers between windows. It appeared that the user was getting a segmentation fault due to the user&amp;rsquo;s computer running out of memory.
I could not reproduce the issue, but my computer has 16 GB. The first thing that came to my mind was to create a virtual machine with less memory to reproduce the issue.</description></item><item><title>Contributing to Krita</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/01/03/contributing-to-krita.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/01/03/contributing-to-krita.html</guid><description>As I mentioned in the [last post]({% post_url 2017-01-02-debugging-an-application-that-freezes-the-x-server %}), I have been learning Qt and using C and C++ again. Since I used C and C++ more during university (about 10 years ago, phew), decided to read real code.
I used Photoshop, Illustrator, and Fireworks a lot when I was younger and had more time to spend drawing. But some time ago I switched to Inkscape for vector graphics, which I use at work for presentations.</description></item><item><title>Debugging an application that freezes the X server</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/01/02/debugging-an-application-that-freezes-the-x-server.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2017/01/02/debugging-an-application-that-freezes-the-x-server.html</guid><description>Some time ago, I decided to start writing C++ again, and picked Krita for that. Krita is written in C++ and Qt. The bug I was working on involved a memory issue when changing the UI.
The problem was that this UI change would result in, not only Krita, but the whole X server freezing. My set up was basically Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, with Eclipse, Qt5, and the latest version of Krita checked out via git.</description></item></channel></rss>
