had learned German. He said that he did, and explained that there are several
dialects, and he was quite proud for some people told him that he was using the
Bavarian dialect correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though &lt;a href="http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher">Cypher&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://gremlindocs.com/">Gremlin&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL&lt;/a>
are all query languages, I think we can consider them dialects of a common graph language.
Cypher is the query language used in &lt;a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">neo4j&lt;/a>, a graph database.
Gremlin is part of the &lt;a href="http://www.tinkerpop.com/">Tinkerpop&lt;/a>, an open source project
that contains graph server, graph algorithms, graph language, among other sub-projects.
And last but not least, SPARQL is used to query &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF documents&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
