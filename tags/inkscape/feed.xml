had two entries that called my attention for being created in Inkscape and for
how nice they looked. Not having used Inkscape for low poly before, I decided
to give it a try.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After reading a handful of tutorials, I realized it is a very interesting
and relaxing process. You use a reference photo with low opacity as background,
and then create the polygons manually with a vector pen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a logo in Inkscape - process</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/02/16/creating-a-logo-in-inkscape-process.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/02/16/creating-a-logo-in-inkscape-process.html</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I spent some computer time not writing or reading code,
but actually toying around with Inkscape to create a logo. While it
created using very simple operations in Inkscape, it took me quite
a while to remember the shortcuts and how to merge objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This logo is not actually used. It was an entry to a call for proposals.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This post won&amp;rsquo;t have much text. It will be more screen shots of the
process with short commentaire.&lt;/p>
