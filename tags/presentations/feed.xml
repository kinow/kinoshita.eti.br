The same slides were used in the Testing and in the Java tracks, though with different titles. The only difference is the demo, that had more details in the latter track.
tdc_2011_goiania_ci by brunodepaulak This was the last talk of the year, I have two more articles to go (MundoJ and STP) and then it will be time to practice slackline, surfing and dedicate some time to my family.</description></item><item><title>Missed JCertif</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2011/09/07/missed-jcertif.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2011/09/07/missed-jcertif.html</guid><description>Unfortunately I missed JCertif last weekend. My visa was in Brazzaville but I couldn't board in a flight from Johannesburg to Congo without it. Max Bonbhel kindly tried to fax me the visa, but the last flight to Congo closed and I had to come back to Brazil sooner. :-(
Here is the slides that I was going to use there. Hope you take some time to read about TAP, SubUnit and other test protocols.</description></item><item><title>TDC 2011 Floripa presentation about running your tests in Jenkins</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2011/08/25/tdc-2011-floripa-presentation-about-running-your-tests-in-jenkins.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2011/08/25/tdc-2011-floripa-presentation-about-running-your-tests-in-jenkins.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend I attended TDC (&lt;a title="The Developers Conference" href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">The Developers Conference&lt;/a>) 2011 in Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. It was my first time in Florianópolis, but the weather was cloudy and cold, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t check out one of the prettiest cities in Brazil :-( Bummer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Putting the weather aside, TDC was great! Basically, there were many nice, easy-going people gathering together to talk about subjects like Java, SOA, Arduino, Testing, Agile and more. I had the chance to talk with skilled and experienced people, see different talks and catch up Guilherme Motta (&lt;a title="@gfcmotta" href="http://www.twitter.com/gfcmotta">@gfcmotta&lt;/a>) from &lt;a title="ThoughtWorks" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks&lt;/a>, who I have met in Porto Alegre in the beginning of this year. He gave an interesting talk about crowd testing using games as example, but varying with applications in different areas too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Belgium Testing Days 2011 Pictures</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2011/03/25/belgium-testing-days-2011-pictures.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2011/03/25/belgium-testing-days-2011-pictures.html</guid><description>Here are some pictures of the event.
