Where it is
called “previsão do tempo”, which is the literal translation
in Portuguese.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post contains some recent screen shots of the weather forecast as it is
presented in one of the main TV channels, as well as some screenshots from an
online video of other local institutions that either provide the forecast, or
help running the NWP models.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
