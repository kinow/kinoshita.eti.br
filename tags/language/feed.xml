Or maybe “Ryoko kosho”. From what I understood he was looking for a mosquito species
found in this place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The species name is “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles_tessellatus">Anopheles tessellatus&lt;/a>”,
and one of its synonyms is “&lt;a href="http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/taxon_descr.aspx?ID=20899">kinoshitai Koidzumi&lt;/a>” — pure
coincidence that &lt;em>kinoshitai&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That synonym entry appears to have been found at the following location:
&lt;strong>Ryukokosho&lt;/strong>, Taihoku (Taipei), Formosa [Taiwan, ROC] (LU). So how to find
Ryukokosho if Google Maps cannot find it, Google brings only a handful of
entries with the species synonyms, and no there are no other maps or other
GIS data available?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning new vocabulary with Shimura Ken Jailbreak story</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/05/23/learning-new-vocabulary-with-shimura-ken-jailbreak-story.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/05/23/learning-new-vocabulary-with-shimura-ken-jailbreak-story.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I watched Shimura Ken (志村 けん) the first time doing his Bakatono-Sama character. With
a simple Japanese, still hard to understand his jokes, but luckily most of his videos were
translated to Portuguese or English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He passed away a few days ago, so I looked for some of his old videos to remember him.
&amp;ldquo;Jailbreak&amp;rdquo; (脱獄物語) is a story about jailed Shimura. His daughter visits him in jail,
and after the guard leaves, Drift Ken starts explaining to his daughter his escape plan.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
