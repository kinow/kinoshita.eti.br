&lt;p>TL;DR: Using the &lt;code>communication method = poll&lt;/code> of Cylc 8 you can easily run
Cylc 8 workflows on BSC MareNostrum5 HPC.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A couple of years ago I gave a talk about &lt;a href="https://eflows4hpc.eu/event/hpc-workflows-for-climate-models/">“HPC workflows for climate models”&lt;/a>
at an ESiWACE3 event. There, I tried to explain in an unbiased way the differences among the workflow
managers commonly used for climate and weather, including &lt;a href="https://autosubmit.readthedocs.io/">Autosubmit&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://ecflow.readthedocs.io/">ecFlow&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://cylc.github.io/">Cylc&lt;/a>. I worked with
the three workflow managers, and developed Cylc while at NIWA in New Zealand, and currently I
develop Autosubmit at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, BSC, in Barcelona Spain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coverage report for a GitHub private repository with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2023/05/29/coverage-report-for-a-github-private-repository-with-github-actions.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 20:36:52 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2023/05/29/coverage-report-for-a-github-private-repository-with-github-actions.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Normally when you add test coverage to a GitHub repository, the reporting part
boils down to a simple call to some API that will post to a third-party external
service like Coveralls or Codecov. Many are already on the GitHub Actions
Market Place and a few lines of YAML are enough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The experiment was a success, and I am convinced one could achieve the same in Jupyter Notebooks. Jenkins could be used as

&lt;p>There are tools out there that can be used to reverse engineer databases and generate diagrams. These tools
normally are GUI based. But &lt;a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc-doc/pull/29">I needed&lt;/a> one that could be used in a
project build to generate a simple diagram for documentation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For Cylc 8 we are adding an initial implementation of GraphQL, to replace the previous REST API.
Besides the technologies in the API&amp;rsquo;s, another difference is that for the REST API, its main
consumer was a PyGTK GUI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new GraphQL API, on the other hand, will be used mainly by a Vue.js Web application. So a
few things need to be done in a different way due to the jump from Desktop GUI to Web GUI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PyZMQ Basics - Part 1</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/03/30/pyzmq-basics-part-1.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2019/03/30/pyzmq-basics-part-1.html</guid><description>&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kinow/art/Old-man-1-657521623" style="float: left;">

This post series is for self understanding of PyZMQ, a ZeroMQ

&lt;h2 id="what-is-zeromq">What is ZeroMQ?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ZeroMQ (or 0MQ, or ØMQ) is an Open Source library that provides building blocks for
communication in distributed applications. The communication can be between the threads
of a process, between process (inter-process), or via network protocols such as
TCP and UDP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is optimized for performance, and has been used in many applications, giving users
a solid foundation to be used in their projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Cylc tasks on PBS Torque with Docker</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/12/22/running-cylc-tasks-on-pbs-torque-with-docker.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/12/22/running-cylc-tasks-on-pbs-torque-with-docker.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days ago I saw &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cylc/dP2I1Gxqi20">a post&lt;/a> at the
Cylc Google Group, about file permissions for files generated by Cylc. The post was related to
content created by Cylc, but in an environment with PBS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context, Cylc is an Open Source meta-scheduler, written in Python, that allows you to
define cycle points with dependencies. These cycle points can be simple incremental integer
numbers, or ISO8601 periods or points (e.g. run every 5 minutes, from 10 days ago until the
next year). Cylc takes care to create an execution schedule for you, and delegate that to a
system that runs your workflow. I work full time on this amazing Open Source tool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such system could be the local computer in background, batch systems such as &lt;code>at&lt;/code>, or PBS.
PBS was created for NASA, to manage executing jobs taking into consideration cluster resources,
and also using queues, priorities, and other features useful for HPC programming. Later PBS
was acquired by Altair, an Open Source version OpenPBS was created, and later abandoned. And
there is another fork called PBS Torque. I first encountered PBS at the São Paulo
University, in Brazil, where they had a &lt;a href="http://www.usp.br/hpc/puma.php">PBS Torque cluster&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="running-pbs-torque-with-docker">Running PBS Torque with Docker&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Even though I have access to an environment with Cylc and with PBS, I decided to give it a try
and see how hard it would be to reproduce it with Docker. One thing that I like about this
approach is the possibility to share the work with others online. I believe it improves
communication, agility, and can be useful for posterity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A couple of class diagrams of JupyterHub</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/10/06/a-couple-of-class-diagrams-of-jupyterhub.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2018/10/06/a-couple-of-class-diagrams-of-jupyterhub.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Started on a new project last Monday.

&lt;p>Pandas provides high-performance data structures in Python. I think in Java there are
similar data structures in projects like Apache Commons Collections,
Google Guava, and also Trove.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Java libraries thread-safety is always a must-have feature. Probably as it is quite
common for a Java program to have more than one thread, especially if the code runs in some
sort of web container.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently learned that Pandas, on the other hand, does not guarantee any thread-safety.
I found that while reading an
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/21150">issue about race condition in the &lt;code>IndexEngine&lt;/code>&lt;/a>,

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Hi Vincent – nice to meet you over email. Apologize for the late reply, I was on PTO for a couple weeks and this is my first week back in office. As Wendy mentioned, I am leading an AR/VR taskforce at Foobar Retail Solutions. The goal of the taskforce is to better understand how AR/VR can apply to retail/commerce and if/what is the role of a shopping center in AR/VR applications for retail.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Wendy mentioned that you would be a great person to speak to since you are close to what is going on in this space. Would love to set up some time to chat via phone next week. What does your availability look like on Monday or Wednesday?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> 
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Best,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Joe Smith
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>

The data
was generated by device (radiosonde) using the vendor (Vaisala) specific binary format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the researchers told me someone had written a parser for his work, and shared it
on GitHub. To be honest, that was my first time parsing data in binary with Python. Did
that before with C, C++, Perl, and Java, but never with Python.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
