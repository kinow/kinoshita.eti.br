<p>This is the first post in a series of three (or maybe four later) based on diagrams
I collected while debugging the Cylc scheduler. The scheduler is called by the <code>cylc start</code>
utility.</p>
<p><em>NB: this is a post to remember things, not really expecting to give someone enough
information to be able to hack the Cylc Scheduler (though you can and would have fun!).</em></p>
<p>Instead of going at length on what happens (and there is quite a bit happening when
you run <code>cylc start my.suite</code>), I will use the following diagram, followed by a few paragraphs
to highlight certain parts. The code used was based on <a href=https://github.com/cylc/cylc/tree/7.7.1>Cylc 7.7.1</a>.</p>
<figure class=feature>

</figure>
<p>When a Cylc command like <code>cylc start</code> is invoked, it actually gets translated into
<code>bin/cylc-$command_name</code>. <code>cylc-start</code> is a Shell file, that will simply call <code>cylc-run</code>.
<code>cylc-run</code> then imports <code>scheduler_cli</code>&mldr; but what you need to know is that in the end
<code>scheduler_cli</code> will create an instance of <code>Scheduler</code> with the right constructor
arguments, and call its <code>start</code> method.</p>
<p>After that point, you are at the left-most lifeline, on the <code>Scheduler</code> constructor
(i.e. the <strong>init</strong> method of the scheduler.py&rsquo;s Scheduler class).</p>
<p>If you follow the method calls - which are hopefully easy to understand and follow -
you will find that the constructor merely creates a few objects, prepares the suite
information, and the suite database.</p>
<p>Then the <code>start</code> method kicks things off, interacting with previously created objects,
but also with some singletons for logging and configuration. Oh, that <code>Cylc</code> banner
is also printed here (in case you would like to customize it as in SpringBoot).</p>
<p>After that, if you are running the suite as daemon, it will be
<a href=http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66012-fork-a-daemon-process-on-unix/>daemonized</a>,
by forking the current process, but with Python.</p>
<p>One important step that happens here, is the initialization of the HTTP Server. This server
will be used to communicate with the <strong>Suite Server Program</strong>. It will be listening to
connections with the right endpoints available only after the <code>configure</code> method.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have <code>configure</code> and <code>run</code> methods, which are two very important methods to be discussed
in the next part of this series, as they are quite extensive, and deserve their own diagrams.</p>
<p>You can download the &lt;a href="/assets/posts{{page.path | remove: &ldquo;.md&rdquo; | remove: &ldquo;_posts&rdquo; }}/cylc-scheduler_cli-workflow-src.png">source file</a> for the diagram used in this post, and edit it
with <a href=https://draw.io>draw.io</a>.</p>
