For context, Cylc is an Open Source meta-scheduler, written in Python, that allows you to define cycle points with dependencies. These cycle points can be simple incremental integer numbers, or ISO8601 periods or points (e.g. run every 5 minutes, from 10 days ago until the next year).

Running PBS Torque with Docker Even though I have access to an environment with Cylc and with PBS, I decided to give it a try and see how hard it would be to reproduce it with Docker.

the logs that were already synced via Docker shared volume (or NFS in other environments).</p><p>The Cylc suite contains a PBS directive <code>-W umask=0077</code>, which forces the logs
to be readable only by the owner. It is possible to confirm it in the output
logs.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is possible now to confirm that <code>rsync</code> has synced the folders, and instead of the
previous <code>-rw-------</code> permissions, both <code>job.out</code> and <code>job.err</code> have <code>-rw-r--r--</code> now.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>This was a good experiment, where I managed to publish some images to DockerHub for Cylc,
though they still lack maturity, and are probably not suitable for production use. There
are two other images in the same GitHub repository for Cylc, but these are even less mature.</p><p>The Cylc PBS image can be used by people familiar with Docker (i.e. who know what and how
to kick). It provides a quick way to test and troubleshoot issues with Cylc and PBS.</p><p>One <a href=https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2911>issue</a> identified during this analysis is that
the log retrieval command may fail in Cylc, but without any output in the logs.</p><p>I believe the problem reported in the Google Groups could be due to <code>rsync</code> not
applying the new <code>chmod</code> values on existing values, but only on new ones. The documentation
for <code>--chmod</code> does not say much, however, if you look under <code>--permissions</code>:</p><blockquote><p>In summary: to give destination files (both old and new) the source permissions, use &ndash;perms. To give new files the destination-default permissions (while leaving existing files
unchanged), make sure that the &ndash;perms option is off and use &ndash;chmod=ugo=rwX (which ensures that all non-masked bits get enabled).</p></blockquote><p>My understanding is that there is a difference on how some settings in <code>rsync</code> work
for new files, and for existing files. I think the documentation could be clearer about it.
The <code>cylc</code> container&rsquo;s <code>rsync</code> version was 3.1.1. I compiled the latest version (3.1.3) on
my Ubuntu LTS, and copied it across to the container, and confirmed the behaviour is the
same (might message the <code>rsync</code> devs later to confirm).</p><p>Finally, I think there is room for improvement in the current log retrieval strategies
in Cylc, and hopefully I will be able to later translate the fuzzy ideas I have in my
mind right now to a simple description to discuss it with other developers, and maybe
improve this feature in the future.</p><p>Live long and prosper!</p><p>♥ Open Source</p><p>Categories:
