<p>Recently a <a href="https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/114/">pull request</a> for Apache Jena
that I started three years ago got merged. Even though it has been three years since
that pull request, there are still many parts of the project code base that I am
not familiar with.</p>

<p>And not only the code, but there are also many concepts about SPARQL, other standards
used in Jena, and internals about triple stores.</p>

<p>The following list contains some presentations and posts that I am reading right now,
while I try to improve my knowledge of SPARQL and Jena internals.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/olafhartig/the-semantics-of-sparql">The Semantics of SPARQL</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Slides with information from Query parsing to Algebra and evaluating the Query</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/SPARQL_Order_Matters">SPARQL Order Matters</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Short but great post from Blazegraph about order in SPARQL queries with JOIN’s
  and LEFT JOIN’s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://gregheartsfield.com/2012/08/26/jena-arq-query-performance.html">Jena ARQ Query Performance</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Old post, but still very useful. Related to the post above, as it also talks about
  query performances due to the order of statements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sql/indexes/predicates-lhs-vs-rhs.html">Predicates: LHS vs RHS</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Oracle post for SQL, but this part applies to SPARQL, at least terminology-wise. LHS
  and RHS appear in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-1534">some SPARQL related tickets</a>
  /documentation too</li>
