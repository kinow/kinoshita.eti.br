Or maybe “Ryoko kosho”. From what I understood he was looking for a mosquito species
found in this place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The species name is “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles_tessellatus">Anopheles tessellatus&lt;/a>”,
and one of its synonyms is “&lt;a href="http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/taxon_descr.aspx?ID=20899">kinoshitai Koidzumi&lt;/a>” — pure
coincidence that &lt;em>kinoshitai&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That synonym entry appears to have been found at the following location:
&lt;strong>Ryukokosho&lt;/strong>, Taihoku (Taipei), Formosa [Taiwan, ROC] (LU). So how to find
Ryukokosho if Google Maps cannot find it, Google brings only a handful of
entries with the species synonyms, and no there are no other maps or other
GIS data available?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning new vocabulary with Shimura Ken Jailbreak story</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/05/23/learning-new-vocabulary-with-shimura-ken-jailbreak-story.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/05/23/learning-new-vocabulary-with-shimura-ken-jailbreak-story.html</guid><description>I watched Shimura Ken (志村 けん) the first time doing his Bakatono-Sama character. With a simple Japanese, still hard to understand his jokes, but luckily most of his videos were translated to Portuguese or English.
He passed away a few days ago, so I looked for some of his old videos to remember him. &amp;ldquo;Jailbreak&amp;rdquo; (脱獄物語) is a story about jailed Shimura. His daughter visits him in jail, and after the guard leaves, Drift Ken starts explaining to his daughter his escape plan.</description></item><item><title>What does food have to do with something being easy?</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/23/what-does-food-have-to-do-with-something-being-easy.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/23/what-does-food-have-to-do-with-something-being-easy.html</guid><description>Some time ago I saw this post on reddit about &amp;ldquo;朝飯前&amp;rdquo; (asa-meshi-mae), literally &amp;ldquo;before the morning meal&amp;rdquo; in Japanese. This is an expression that has the same meaning as piece of cake, meaning that something is very easy.
From the comments in that thread, there are more examples.
In English &amp;quot;&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; for breakfast&amp;quot; means that something is very easy.
I eat punks like you for breakfast
In Chinese &amp;ldquo;小菜一碟&amp;rdquo; (xiao3 cai4 yi4 die2) translates to &amp;ldquo;a plate of small dish&amp;rdquo;, and has the same meaning.</description></item><item><title>The etymology of bombast</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</guid><description>On &amp;ldquo;On Writing Well&amp;rdquo;, Zinsser wrote:
&amp;ldquo;There is a deep yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast.&amp;rdquo;
I thought &amp;ldquo;bombast&amp;rdquo; would be related to the Portuguese word &amp;ldquo;bombástico&amp;rdquo;, which can mean something like fantastic, amazing.
Turns out it has a different meaning. Google defines it as:
high-sounding language with little meaning, used to impress people.
But it also an interesting etymology.
1570s, &amp;ldquo;cotton padding,&amp;rdquo; corrupted from earlier bombace &amp;ldquo;raw cotton&amp;rdquo; (1550s), from Old French bombace &amp;ldquo;cotton, cotton wadding,&amp;rdquo; from Late Latin bombacem, accusative of bombax &amp;ldquo;cotton, &amp;rsquo;linteorum aut aliae quaevis quisquiliae,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; a corruption and transferred use of Latin bombyx &amp;ldquo;silk,&amp;rdquo; from Greek bombyx &amp;ldquo;silk, silkworm&amp;rdquo; (which also came to mean &amp;ldquo;cotton&amp;rdquo; in Medieval Greek), from some oriental word, perhaps related to Iranian pambak (modern panba) or Armenian bambok, perhaps ultimately from a PIE root meaning &amp;ldquo;to twist, wind.</description></item></channel></rss>
