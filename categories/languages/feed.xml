Or maybe “Ryoko kosho”. From what I understood he was looking for a mosquito species
found in this place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The species name is “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles_tessellatus">Anopheles tessellatus&lt;/a>”,
and one of its synonyms is “&lt;a href="http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/taxon_descr.aspx?ID=20899">kinoshitai Koidzumi&lt;/a>” — pure
coincidence that &lt;em>kinoshitai&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That synonym entry appears to have been found at the following location:
&lt;strong>Ryukokosho&lt;/strong>, Taihoku (Taipei), Formosa [Taiwan, ROC] (LU). So how to find
Ryukokosho if Google Maps cannot find it, Google brings only a handful of
entries with the species synonyms, and no there are no other maps or other
GIS data available?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning new vocabulary with Shimura Ken Jailbreak story</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/05/23/learning-new-vocabulary-with-shimura-ken-jailbreak-story.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/05/23/learning-new-vocabulary-with-shimura-ken-jailbreak-story.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I watched Shimura Ken (志村 けん) the first time doing his Bakatono-Sama character. With
a simple Japanese, still hard to understand his jokes, but luckily most of his videos were
translated to Portuguese or English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He passed away a few days ago, so I looked for some of his old videos to remember him.
&amp;ldquo;Jailbreak&amp;rdquo; (脱獄物語) is a story about jailed Shimura. His daughter visits him in jail,
and after the guard leaves, Drift Ken starts explaining to his daughter his escape plan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What does food have to do with something being easy?</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/23/what-does-food-have-to-do-with-something-being-easy.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/23/what-does-food-have-to-do-with-something-being-easy.html</guid><description>&lt;a href="https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/04/04/apple-2.html">

&lt;p>Some time ago I saw &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/dsknqj/japanese_idiom_%E6%9C%9D%E9%A3%AF%E5%89%8D_asameshimae_lit_before/">this post&lt;/a>
on reddit about &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;朝飯前&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> (asa-meshi-mae), literally &amp;ldquo;before the morning meal&amp;rdquo; in Japanese.
This is an expression that has the same meaning as &lt;strong>piece of cake&lt;/strong>, meaning that something is very easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the comments in that thread, there are more examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In English &lt;strong>&amp;quot;&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; for breakfast&amp;quot;&lt;/strong> means that something is very easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I eat punks like you for breakfast&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In Chinese &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;小菜一碟&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> (xiao3 cai4 yi4 die2) translates to &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;a plate of small dish&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>,
and has the same meaning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The etymology of bombast</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2020/02/22/the-etymology-of-bombast.html</guid><description>&lt;figure class="feature">

&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548">&amp;ldquo;On Writing Well&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>,
Zinsser wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There is a deep yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I thought &amp;ldquo;bombast&amp;rdquo; would be related to the Portuguese word &amp;ldquo;bombástico&amp;rdquo;,
which can mean something like fantastic, amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out it has a different meaning. Google defines it as:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>high-sounding language with little meaning, used to impress people.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But it also an interesting &lt;a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/bombast">etymology&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>1570s, &amp;ldquo;cotton padding,&amp;rdquo; corrupted from earlier bombace &amp;ldquo;raw cotton&amp;rdquo; (1550s), from Old French bombace &amp;ldquo;cotton, cotton wadding,&amp;rdquo; from Late Latin bombacem, accusative of bombax &amp;ldquo;cotton, &amp;rsquo;linteorum aut aliae quaevis quisquiliae,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; a corruption and transferred use of Latin bombyx &amp;ldquo;silk,&amp;rdquo; from Greek bombyx &amp;ldquo;silk, silkworm&amp;rdquo; (which also came to mean &amp;ldquo;cotton&amp;rdquo; in Medieval Greek), from some oriental word, perhaps related to Iranian pambak (modern panba) or Armenian bambok, perhaps ultimately from a PIE root meaning &amp;ldquo;to twist, wind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
