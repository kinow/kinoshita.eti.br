about: |
  I have {\bf 20 years of experience} working in different industries such as telecommunications, banking,
  credit, retail, insurance, research, government, civil construction, and start-ups, with a {\bf wide
  variety of roles} (developer, quality engineer, devops, architect, etc.). I program in Python, Java,
  JavaScript, PHP, and Shell Script. I am fluent in English and Portuguese. I have an
  intermediate level in Spanish and Japanese, and basic in French and Te Reo M\={a}ori.\\[0.1em]

#  My main interests are NLP, Semantic Web, GIS, Workflow Management Systems, Data Journalism, and {\bf Open Source}
#  (including Community Management and Developer Relations).
#
#  I value the {\bf impact of the project} (e.g. work on climate change, accessibility, inclusion, open data, disease
#  control, education, research, etc.) over technology and salary. I am a New Zealand tax resident, able
#  to work in person in New Zealand, Australia, and Latin America -- otherwise visa sponsorship is required.
