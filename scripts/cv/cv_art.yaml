about: |
  I worked most of my career as a Software Engineer designing applications
  for the web. I have experience in different industries and am used to
  handling projects with deadlines and that involve multiple teams and
  stakeholders. \\[0.5em]

  My interests include web design, editorial illustration, figurative drawing,
  and general illustration. I am curious to experiment with different media
  to express concepts and ideas. \\[0.5em]

  I am fluent in English and Portuguese, with good understanding of
  Spanish, and basic of Japanese. Attended Te Reo Maori beginner classes
  to learn basic vocabulary and pronunciation.
