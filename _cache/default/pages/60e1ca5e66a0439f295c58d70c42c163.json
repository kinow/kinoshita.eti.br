The reason is that I have been busy fixing bugs in <a title=\"Jenkins TestLink Plug-in\" href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin\">Jenkins TestLink Plug-in</a>, <a title=\"TestLink\" href=\"http://www.teamst.org\">TestLink</a>, <a title=\"TestLink Java API\" href=\"http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/\">TestLink Java API</a>, <a title=\"tap4j\" href=\"http://www.tap4j.org\">tap4j</a>, <a title=\"Jenkins TAP Plug-in\" href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin\">Jenkins TAP Plug-in</a> and other Open Source projects.\n\nRecently I left <a title=\"Sysmap Solutions\" href=\"http://www.sysmap.com.br\">Sysmap Solutions</a>, where I was a consultant, to have my labor card signed by <a title=\"Lojas Riachuelo\" href=\"http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br\">Lojas Riachuelo</a>, a famous Brazilian fashion retailer (like C&amp;A, Zara, H&amp;M and so on), part of Guararapes group.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.lojasriachuelo.com.br\" title=\"Lojas Riachuelo\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-781\" title=\"riachuelo\" src=\"{{ assets.riachuelo}}\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"125\" /></a></p>\n\nSo I am still getting used to the new routine, new systems and be a employee rather than a consultant.\n\nThere are also two talks to come, one in a few days at <a title=\"The Developers Conferecen\" href=\"http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br\">TDC</a> (The Developers Conference) 2011 in Florian&oacute;polis, and another one in the beginning of September at <a title=\"JCertif\" href=\"http://www.jcertif.com\">JCertif</a> in Congo/Brazzaville. While I already bought the tickets and booked the hotel rooms, I still have to finish some slides and practical examples for both events.\n\nI already have two draft posts that I am still writing. One about continuous integration and parallelism/concurrency, and another one about spell check in DocBook projects, specially if you are using Maven.\n\nToday I had a new idea for a bioinformatics tool that is may be helpful for researchers and bioinformatics professionals. I will write about it as soon as I find some spare time, so stay tuned ;)\n\nTime to get back to work!\n\nCheers", "o": 152, "f": null}]}}
