This is the first post in a series of three (or maybe four later) based on diagrams
I collected while debugging the Cylc scheduler. The scheduler is called by the `cylc start`
utility.

*NB: this is a post to remember things, not really expecting to give someone enough
information to be able to hack the Cylc Scheduler (though you can and would have fun!).*

Instead of going at length on what happens (and there is quite a bit happening when
you run `cylc start my.suite`), I will use the following diagram, followed by a few paragraphs
to highlight certain parts. The code used was based on [Cylc 7.7.1](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/tree/7.7.1).

When a Cylc command like `cylc start` is invoked, it actually gets translated into
`bin/cylc-$command_name`. `cylc-start` is a Shell file, that will simply call `cylc-run`.
`cylc-run` then imports `scheduler_cli`... but what you need to know is that in the end
`scheduler_cli` will create an instance of `Scheduler` with the right constructor
arguments, and call its `start` method.

After that point, you are at the left-most lifeline, on the `Scheduler` constructor
(i.e. the __init__ method of the scheduler.py's Scheduler class).

If you follow the method calls - which are hopefully easy to understand and follow -
you will find that the constructor merely creates a few objects, prepares the suite
information, and the suite database.

Then the `start` method kicks things off, interacting with previously created objects,
but also with some singletons for logging and configuration. Oh, that `Cylc` banner
is also printed here (in case you would like to customize it as in SpringBoot).

After that, if you are running the suite as daemon, it will be
[daemonized](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66012-fork-a-daemon-process-on-unix/),
by forking the current process, but with Python.

One important step that happens here, is the initialization of the HTTP Server. This server
will be used to communicate with the **Suite Server Program**. It will be listening to
connections with the right endpoints available only after the `configure` method.

Lastly, we have `configure` and `run` methods, which are two very important methods to be discussed
in the next part of this series, as they are quite extensive, and deserve their own diagrams.

You can download the <a href="{{ assets['cylc-scheduler_cli-workflow-src'] }}">source file</a> for the diagram used in this post, and edit it
with [draw.io](https://draw.io).
