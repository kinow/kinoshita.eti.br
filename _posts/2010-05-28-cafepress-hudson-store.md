If you use Hudson as build trigger, continuous integration system or crontab replacement, you can contribute to Hudson buying from <a title="CafePress Hudson Store" href="http://www.cafepress.com/hudson_ci/">CafePress Hudson Store</a>. I bought a polo shirt few months ago. It was my first acquisition from CafePress and I was worried about quality and the difference in sizes from US and Brazil.

However the quality was very good and it fitted perfectly. I wear P in Brazil and bought a S white polo shirt. I believe that after the currency conversion, I paid like R$ 30 plus post.
