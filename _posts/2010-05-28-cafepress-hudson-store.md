If you use Hudson as build trigger, continuous integration system or crontab replacement, you can contribute to Hudson buying from <a title="CafePress Hudson Store" href="http://www.cafepress.com/hudson_ci/">CafePress Hudson Store</a>. I bought a polo shirt few months ago. It was my first acquisition from CafePress and I was worried about quality and the difference in sizes from US and Brazil.

<div class="ui container" style='text-align: center;'>

<a href="{{ assets['190746197v3_150x150_Front_Color-White'] }}" rel="prettyPhoto" class="thumbnail" title="">
<img class="ui fluid image" src="{{ assets['190746197v3_150x150_Front_Color-White'] }}" alt="=" />
</a>

However the quality was very good and it fitted perfectly. I wear P in Brazil and bought a S white polo shirt. I believe that after the currency conversion, I paid like R$ 30 plus post.
