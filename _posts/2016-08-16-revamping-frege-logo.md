For a while I had been wanting to try adding a flat colour to the Frege
logo. This weekend had some bit of spare time, and here is the result.

Submitted to the project as [pull request #299](https://github.com/Frege/frege/pull/299/files).

Current logo.

<img class="ui centered large image" src="/assets/posts{{page.path | remove: ".md" | remove: "_posts" }}/Frege_logo.png" alt="Frege current logo" />

And the updated logo.

<img class="ui centered large image" src="/assets/posts{{page.path | remove: ".md" | remove: "_posts" }}/Frege_logo_flat_colours.png" alt="Frege updated logo" />

The colour used was Flamingo (#EF4836), found in [Flat UI Color Picker](http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/).

Perhaps not exactly revamping, since all I did was just change a colour. There were
adjustments to the b&eacute;zier curves as well, to better align them, but I updated both
logos, not just the new one :-)
