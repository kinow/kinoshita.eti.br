    New logo for the Apache OpenNLP project, <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-6.>
---

This project was completed combining an idea of Koji Sekiguchi.

Logo created in **Inkscape** for a project that uses **natural language processing**. The idea
was to create something related with text, that was easy to regognzie, and could be used
in the website, promotional material, favicon, etc.

The **Apache Software Foundation** symbol is a feather, which we used as a
writing feather in the logo. That combined with the letters NLP
create an image that is easy to recognize.

It has been used in the project website and documentation, Wikipedia,
presentations, and other promotional material.
