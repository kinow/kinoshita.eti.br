title: Revamping Frege logo &mdash; part 2
---

Last time I used Blender was around 2007 I think, in University. But the bad weather in
Auckland gives me plenty of time to have fun checking out Blender again :-)

Followed the following tutorials:

* [How to create a 3D Logo in Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeKhH1aaXuM)
* [Blender Tutorial Spinning Logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LArn4TFNnmk)

Here are the work in progress, created only with the b&eacute;zier curve.

Here's the result after the mesh was created, and some material applied.

Then using a plane as background, replacing the lamp by a sun, and tweaking a few parameters.

And finally playing with animation. Not sure if there was a time line and animation controls in
Blender the last time I used it, but the controls are not really complex.

I had to combine both meshes into a single object, in order to add a bone and rotate it. That
is why the logo got back to a single material. The angle of the camera could probably do with
some tweaking as well.

But it was my very first time animating in Blender. Some day if I get access to one of those
3D printers, I will check what are the requirements for printing this logo.

Blender models can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kinow/kinoshita.eti.br/tree/master/posts/2016-08-24_revamping-frege-logo-part-2-assets).

Now back to programming :-)
