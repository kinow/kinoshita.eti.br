Since I started reading cylc's source code in Eclipse to create some
sequence diagrams, I have not been able to debug it properly without
hitting errors in some part of the program execution.

The error message was **_&ldquo;ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref&rdquo;_**,
which was a bit enigmatic as I never heard about that function, but it seemed to be
something internal, or at least not from the project code base. And searching the Internet
did not help much.

Here is the complete console output in Eclipse.

As the current diagram I am working on has quite a few `if`'s and `else`'s, I decided
to investigate why this error was occurring. Then, after some elimination I found that
it was due to the missing Anaconda 2 entry in my `$PATH` environment variable.

I had this variable configured in a custom script I load whenever I decide to use
Anaconda 2. And reproducing the same behaviour in Eclipse was easy.

Et voil&agrave;! Eclipse was happily debugging again!

So if you have a similar problem, try comparing your environment variables and check if you
have some entries missing, and try adding them in Eclipse Debug configuration.

Happy cycling!
