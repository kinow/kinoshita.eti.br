title: Article about metrics and code analysis published
---

I wrote an article about a quality analysis job done for a client of <a title="Sysmap Solutions" href="http://www.sysmap.com.br">Sysmap Solutions</a> and it was published by <a title="Testing Experience" href="http://www.testingexperience.com">TestingExperience</a> Magazine on its issue of September, number 11.

You can check the full article in TestingExperience site. It is available in PDF format for members, the registration if free though.

Happy reading.
