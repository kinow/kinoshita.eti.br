On November 6th (next Saturday) <a title="Anderson Santos" href="http://andersonxp.tumblr.com/">Anderson Santos</a> and I will present a Test Automation solution built on <a title="TestLink" href="http://www.teamst.org/">TestLink</a> and <a title="Hudson" href="http://www.hudson-ci.org">Hudson</a> at <a title="Encontro &Aacute;gil 2010" href="http://www.encontroagil.com.br/">Encontro &Aacute;gil 2010</a>. This meeting is for intended for the Agile community and will be hold at <a title="IME-USP" href="www.ime.usp.br">IME-USP</a> (Instituto de Matem&aacute;tica e Estat&iacute;stica - Universidade de S&aacute;o Paulo).

In our demonstration we will be using TestLink 1.9 HEAD version, Hudson 1.366 and <a title="TestLink Hudson Plug-in" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/TestLink+Plugin">TestLink Hudson Plug-in</a> 2.0-SNAPSHOT. This TestLink Hudson Plug-in version is still not released as we are finishing to code the integration between the plug-in and TAP through <a title="tap4j" href="http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/">tap4j</a>, an implementation of <a title="Test Anything Protocol" href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP - Test Anything Protocol</a>.

What is nice about this solution is that we aren't trying to use TestLink as an Automation Tool. But yes, as a Test Management Tool (what TestLink is by nature). And the choice of the Test Execution Tool is up to you, as long as you generate TAP Stream (basically, files containing a log of tests executed). We only enable you to have these tests updated on your TestLink installation, this way you can plan a Test Cycle with both Manual and Automated Tests in one single tool.

And lastly but not less important, this week <a title="Testing Experience Magazine" href="http://www.testingexperience.com/">Testing Experience Magazine</a> accepted a proposal of article for the next issue on Open Source Tools about this solution. So we are working very hard to release TestLink Hudson Plug-in new version and spread this Test Automation Solution through the Testing/Quality community.

Cheers
