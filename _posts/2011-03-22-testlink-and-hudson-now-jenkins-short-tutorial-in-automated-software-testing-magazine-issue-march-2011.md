Hi there, a new article about TestLink and Hudson (now Jenkins) was published, now in <a title="Automated Software Institute" href="http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/">Automated Software Testing Magazine</a>, issue March 2011. In this article you will find a short tutorial to set up a TestNG test and a simple Job to execute your automated tests.
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/ASTMagazine/2011/AutomatedSoftwareTestingMagazine_March2011.pdf"><img class="size-full wp-image-636 aligncenter" title="Automated Software Testing Magazine, issue March 2011." src="{{ assets.March11Cover_small }}" alt="" width="224" height="290" /></a></span></p>
Now we are writing a <a title="DocBook" href="http://www.docbook.org/">docbook</a> document to explain with more details how the plug-in works and how you can play with it. We are also working in more samples, translation and video demos. Release 2.2 was planned for last Friday but I missed the date to add a new feature: TestLink platforms, this is the last known limitation in the plug-in.

Cheers :-)
