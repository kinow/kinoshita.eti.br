I just had a two week vacation, and I tried to use my time to rest, play some music, and
complete a geek todo-list. 

The list included things that I used some time ago but wanted to
refresh my memory, things that I already used but never spent time reading the manuals, and
other things that I saw somewhere but never actually used in any project.

Here the complete list, with the items that were completed highlighted. Some links with
pointers to what I used to study.
