Having worked in Open Source for a few years, one of my favorite things is when you can
share experience with other people that you meet. [Andrew Gray](https://github.com/agray)
has worked with .NET and Jenkins for years, and we met through Open Source. He has helped me
in the past with Jenkins and .NET, and also maintains the blog
[Jenkins.NET](http://jenkinsheaven.blogspot.co.nz/).

A couple of days ago he sent me an interesting question. He asked me if that would be possible
to use Active Choices Plug-in with the [Role Strategy Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Role+Strategy+Plugin). This plug-in lets you define roles, define which permissions a role has, and then assign users to the roles.

The idea was to show a set of parameters that would vary according to the user roles. So, say that the user
is a tester. Then s/he would see certain parameters. But if s/he was a manager, other parameters would be
displayed.

## To the code

{% geshi 'java' %}
import hudson.model.User
import hudson.model.Hudson
import hudson.security.AuthorizationStrategy
import hudson.security.Permission
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap

AuthorizationStrategy strategy = Hudson.getInstance().getAuthorizationStrategy();

jobs = []
user = User.current()
userId = user.getId()

if (strategy != null && strategy instanceof com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy) {
    roleStrategy = (RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy) strategy;
    // not very straightforward to get the groups for a given user
    roles = roleStrategy.getGrantedRoles("globalRoles")
    for (entry in roles) {
        role = entry.key
        users = entry.value
        if (role.getName().equals("tester")) {
            if (userId in users) {
                jobs = ["PROJECT_FOR_TESTERS1", "PROJECT_FOR_TESTERS2"]
                break
            }
        } else if (role.getName().equals("admin")) {
            if (userId in users) {
                jobs = ["PROJECT_FOR_ADMINS1", "PROJECT_FOR_ADMINS2"]
                break
            }
        }
    }
}

return jobs
// TODO: handle anonymous user ;-)
{% endgeshi %}

And now let's dissect the code.

{% geshi 'java' %}
import hudson.model.User
import hudson.model.Hudson
import hudson.security.AuthorizationStrategy
import hudson.security.Permission
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap
{% endgeshi %}

You start by importing the classes that you need.

{% geshi 'java' %}
AuthorizationStrategy strategy = Hudson.getInstance().getAuthorizationStrategy();

jobs = []
user = User.current()
userId = user.getId()
{% endgeshi %}

The first line gets the current [AuthorizationStrategy](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/f6e431b80c4d162560419fa51633224a9724bb0d/core/src/main/java/hudson/security/AuthorizationStrategy.java)
used in Jenkins.

Then we create an empty array of jobs, which is the value returned by default. And get the current
logged in user ID.

{% geshi 'java' %}
if (strategy != null && strategy instanceof com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy) {
    roleStrategy = (RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy) strategy;
    // not very straightforward to get the groups for a given user
    roles = roleStrategy.getGrantedRoles("globalRoles")
    for (entry in roles) {
        role = entry.key
        users = entry.value
        if (role.getName().equals("tester")) {
            if (userId in users) {
                jobs = ["PROJECT_FOR_TESTERS1", "PROJECT_FOR_TESTERS2"]
                break
            }
        } else if (role.getName().equals("admin")) {
            if (userId in users) {
                jobs = ["PROJECT_FOR_ADMINS1", "PROJECT_FOR_ADMINS2"]
                break
            }
        }
    }
}

return jobs
// TODO: handle anonymous user ;-)
{% endgeshi %}

The final part simply iterates through each existing role, and then through the
users in that role. I could not find a more elegant way of doing that, but in case
you would like to maybe optimize the code, here are the main classes that I
used from Jenkins to write the script.

* [RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/b6dca7904ce1c83b3afef0995ef5f42823171b0b/src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java)
* [Role.java](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/Role.java)
* [RoleMap](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/b6dca7904ce1c83b3afef0995ef5f42823171b0b/src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleMap.java)
* [User.java](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/f6e431b80c4d162560419fa51633224a9724bb0d/core/src/main/java/hudson/model/User.java)

Normally I either use my local working copy of Jenkins project imported in Eclipse, or use the
"Find File" feature in GitHub. Then remember a little bit about Jenkins Java API to walk
through the classes and write the Groovy code (I made a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmPJvJGEFb4) about writing Groovy with Auto Complete in
Eclipse, but that's in Portuguese only).

## What the result looks like in Jenkins

In this section we have just simple screenshots, showing the script in the job configuration.

<div class='row'>
<div class="ui container" style='text-align: center;'>
<figure>
<a href="{{assets.screenshot01}}" rel="prettyPhoto" class="thumbnail" title="Screenshot 01">
<img class="ui fluid image" src="{{assets.screenshot01}}" alt="Screenshot 01" />
</a>
<figcaption>Screenshot 01</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

And the resulting screen. The parameter **DeployAPP** will be available during the build,
and can be used to trigger other jobs or pipelines.

## Where can you find this script?

This blog post has a copy of the script, but I have also submitted
a pull request to a [repository](https://github.com/imoutsatsos/jenkins-scriptlets)
maintained by another friend, [Ioannis Moutsatsos](https://github.com/imoutsatsos). Ioannis
maintains a Jenkins installation in Novartis, and is probably the most skillful user
of the Active Choices Plug-in.

Another advantage of this other copy, is that it may be updated with time, in case there are
bugs or improvements. So watch Ioannis' repository for updates!

ps: I've also met Ioannis through Open Source code, and have learned a lot by working with him. 

â™¥ Open Source!
