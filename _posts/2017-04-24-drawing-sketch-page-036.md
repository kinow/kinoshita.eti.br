Almost ANZAC day. And almost time to switch back to coding Jenkins plug-ins.

Normally sketch more in-between development cycles for Open Source projects, or
contract works.

* [Krill](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/krill/): Krill are small crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, and are found in all the world's oceans. The name krill comes from the Norwegian word krill, meaning "small fry of fish", which is also often attributed to species of fish.
* [Tui](http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/tui): Tui are boisterous, medium-sized, common and widespread bird of forest and suburbia â€“ unless you live in Canterbury. They look black from a distance, but in good light tui have a blue, green and bronze iridescent sheen, and distinctive white throat tufts (poi). They are usually very vocal, with a complicated mix of tuneful notes interspersed with coughs, grunts and wheezes. In flight, their bodies slant with the head higher than the tail, and their noisy whirring flight is interspersed with short glides.
* [Fatigue or Craziness](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/209171-at-bottom-you-see-we-are-not-homo-sapiens-as): Lots of crazy people on Queen Street during holidays.
