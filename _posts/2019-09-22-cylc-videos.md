Last week I put together a playlist with all Cylc videos I could found on Youtube.

<iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLxlfTM52ynRZZ7rtLkoKANWiIFn92d6je"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="autoplay;encrypted-media"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>

Clicking on the video above should open the YouTube playlist, with the next videos
on the right. They are sorted from the newest to the oldest (upload date).
