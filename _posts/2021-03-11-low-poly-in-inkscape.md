The [last Inkscape about screen contest](https://inkscape.org/news/2021/01/23/about-screen-contest-inkscape-11-started/)
had two entries that called my attention for being created in Inkscape and for
how nice they looked. Not having used Inkscape for low poly before, I decided
to give it a try.

After reading a handful of tutorials, I realized it is a very interesting
and relaxing process. You use a reference photo with low opacity as background,
and then create the polygons manually with a vector pen.

If I had to create many of these low poly images, I would probably automate it.
First looking for existing plug-ins or tools, or writing a simple script that
randomly creates the polygons based on a seed with some variance.

The final result is very interesting for the eyes, creating an image that is easy
to “read” and can be used for social media and websites.
