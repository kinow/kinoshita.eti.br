title: 'Paper: Patterns for Introducing a Superclass for Test Classes'
---

Few days ago we had [SugarLoafPlop 2012](http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/) in [Natal - RN](http://maps.google.com.br/maps?q=natal+-+rn&hl=en&sll=-23.682803,-46.595546&sspn=0.653971,1.352692&hnear=Natal+-+Rio+Grande+do+Norte&t=m&z=11) 

It is a conference on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language" title="Pattern Language">pattern languages</a> of programming. About six months ago I saw a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/emguerra" title="Eduardo Guerra">Eduardo Guerra</a> asking if anyone had some cases where certain patterns were applied. It was a big coincidence, since I was working on <a href="http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/functor/" title="Apache Commons Functor">Apache Commons Functor</a> and some <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins-CI">Jenkins plugins</a>, both projects with cases that could be used in his paper.

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/"><img src="{{assets.sugarloaf2012_300_146}}" alt="" title="SugarLoaf Plop 2012" width="300" height="146" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1071" /></a>

So I joined Guerra and gave my small contribution to the paper that <a href="http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/pages/acceptedpapers.html" title="accepted papers">has been accepted</a> for this edition of SugarLoafPlop. Guerra also went there to give a talk and participate in an open discussion about several papers, including ours.

I simply love when these things happen, it was great work with Guerra, and even better for being able to use Open Source examples in our paper.
