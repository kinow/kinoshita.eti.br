If you ever started Krita 3.x in your command line, and had a look at the console output,
you may noticed the following warning.

>QLayout: Attempting to add QLayout "" to QWidget "", which already has a layout

Krita just announced the release of 3.1.1-alpha-2, and while testing I saw this warning and
decided, as part of Qt learning, to investigate why this warning was happening.

As normally happens, there was already
[a similar question posted to StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25451334). And the
best answer's initial paragraph gave me a hint of what to look for.

>When you assign a widget as the parent of a QLayout by passing it into the constructor, the layout is automatically set as the layout for that widget. In your code you are not only doing this, but explicitly calling setlayout(). This is no problem when when the widget passed is the same. If they are different you will get an error because Qt tries to assign the second layout to your widget which has already had a layout set.

So, somewhere in Krita code, there was a a QWidget that was created, and a layout
was added to it more than once. To find that it was quite easy. A breakpoint at
[main.cc](https://github.com/KDE/krita/blob/9e2b8c5b07deccd4a616ad7930a91e8cc784a85b/krita/main.cc#L141)
when the application is initialized, then step through a few times, until I saw that message in the
console.

Further investigation led me to the History docker (the one that shows undo steps)
[constructor](https://github.com/KDE/krita/blob/9e2b8c5b07deccd4a616ad7930a91e8cc784a85b/plugins/dockers/historydocker/HistoryDock.cpp#L33).

{% geshi 'c++' %}
    QVBoxLayout *vl = new QVBoxLayout(page);
    m_undoView = new KisUndoView(this);
    vl->addWidget(m_undoView);
    QHBoxLayout *hl = new QHBoxLayout(page);
    hl->addSpacerItem(new QSpacerItem(10, 1,  QSizePolicy::Expanding, QSizePolicy::Fixed));
    m_bnConfigure = new QToolButton(page);
    m_bnConfigure->setIcon(KisIconUtils::loadIcon("configure"));
    connect(m_bnConfigure, SIGNAL(clicked(bool)), SLOT(configure()));
    hl->addWidget(m_bnConfigure);
    vl->addItem(hl);

    setWidget(page);
    setWindowTitle(i18n("Undo History"));
{% endgeshi %}

Here the QWidget created receives both QHBoxLayout and QVBoxLayout. Again, searching the Internet
a little bit, then came across this post with a good example of a QWidget with
QHBoxLayout and QVBoxLayout. Here's what the constructor looks after the
[patch](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378313)
has been [applied](https://github.com/KDE/krita/commit/1d2343c0cacfb0b105fbe86c2bcef975a09b1041).

{% geshi 'c++' %}
    QVBoxLayout *vl = new QVBoxLayout(page);
    m_undoView = new KisUndoView(this);
    vl->addWidget(m_undoView);
    QHBoxLayout *hl = new QHBoxLayout();
    hl->addSpacerItem(new QSpacerItem(10, 1,  QSizePolicy::Expanding, QSizePolicy::Fixed));
    m_bnConfigure = new QToolButton(page);
    m_bnConfigure->setIcon(KisIconUtils::loadIcon("configure"));
    connect(m_bnConfigure, SIGNAL(clicked(bool)), SLOT(configure()));
    hl->addWidget(m_bnConfigure);
    vl->addItem(hl);
    vl->addLayout(hl);

    setWidget(page);
    setWindowTitle(i18n("Undo History"));
{% endgeshi %}

That's it. Learned something new in Qt. Not as important and useful as learning about signals
and slots, but now I can focus on other warnings in the console output of Krita ;)
