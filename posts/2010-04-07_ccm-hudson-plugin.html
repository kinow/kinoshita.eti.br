CCM is a tool developed by Jonas Blunck (<a href="http://www.blunck.se/">http://www.blunck.se</a>). It's able to calculate the cyclomatic complexity (McCabe) of a .NET Project or Solution.

I developed <a title="TestLink Hudson Plug-In" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/TestLink+Plugin">TestLink Hudson Plug-in</a>, a <a href="http://www.hudson-ci.org">Hudson </a>Plug-in that lets you invoke CCM from hudson and have the results displayed in the console output. I chose CCM as CC tool for .NET instead of SourceMonitor after it gave me a CC value of 4 for a method I was sure was supposed to have 5.
