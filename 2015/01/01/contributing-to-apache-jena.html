It has served us very well so far.

I am using <a href=http://jena.apache.org>Apache Jena</a> for a project of a customer. I had never used
any triple store, nor a SPARQL Endpoint server before. But for being involved with the Apache
Software Foundation, and since the company itself is using several Apache components, it was only
natural Jena to be our first choice.</p><p>It has served us very well so far. At the moment we have less than 100 queries per day, but the
project is still under development and we expect 1000 queries per day by the first quarter of
2015 and 1000000 near the end of 2015. We also have few entries in TDB, but expect to grow this
number to a few million before 2016.</p><p>When I work for companies and we use Open Source Software (OSS) in a project, I always
prepare assessment reports to include in the deliveries. In this report I justify the choice
of Open Source Software (as well as commercial software). Sometimes I
am lucky to work for a company that asks me to include hours to work on OSS :-)</p><p>I use <a href=https://trello.com>Trello</a> to triage issues in OSS projects (and for several other
things). I have a board with several cards for Open Source. About a month ago I set up one
for Jena and listed the issues that I thought I could contribute to.</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2015-01-01-contributing-to-apache-jena/jena_trello.png alt title width height><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I annotate easy issues with a &ldquo;lhf&rdquo; suffix for Low Hanging Fruit issues, and delete issues from
the card once I submit a patch or update it (and include it in another card for the
<a href=https://tupilabs.github.io/tag/tupilabs-report/>TupiLabs reports</a>).</p><p>Most of the issues I included in the card for Jena had been created over two years ago, and hadn&rsquo;t
been updated in a while. When you test these issues against the current code, usually you find that
some of them have already been fixed. Other issues included documentation problems, and minor features. I didn&rsquo;t find any blocker issue that would impede us to use Jena in production.</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2015-01-01-contributing-to-apache-jena/jena_jira.png alt title width height><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The picture above shows the past 30 days activity summary in JIRA for Jena. The red line shows
issues created, and the green line issues resolved. <a href=https://github.com/afs>Andy Seaborne</a>
was very active in the past days and fixed several issues that were too old and had already been fixed in the trunk, and kindly merged patches and pull requests.</p><p>Some issues like <a href=https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-632>JENA-632</a> will take a
longer time to fix, but I&rsquo;m getting used to Jena&rsquo;s source code, and at the same getting more
confident to use it in production - especially with a supportive OSS community. We are using
Jena for RDF with Hadoop, and I learned that I can replace some custom Writables by others
in the Jena Hadoop submodule.</p><p>By the way, even though this project ends in April, I intend to continue contributing to Jena.
There is a lot of parts of the code that I would love to be able to understand and contribute,
in special the Graph database, optimization techniques for SPARQL queries, the grammars used
in the project, Fuseki v2 and enhance its testing harness (as well as the test coverage).</p><p><strong>If you are looking for a interesting project to get you started with semantics, linked data,
RDF, and even graphs and database querying, try contributing to Jena. I bet you&rsquo;ll have a lot
of fun!</strong></p><p>Happy hacking and happy 2015!</p><p>Categories:
