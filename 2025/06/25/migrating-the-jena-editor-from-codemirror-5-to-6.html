to 6.0.1. The build failed, as there were breaking changes in the CodeMirror

<a href=https://codemirror.net/docs/migration/>migrate and update their code</a>.</p><p>After following their documentation, unfortunately there were still build

available. The solution for that problem was to use the
<a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/codemirror-lang-turtle>codemirror-lang-turtle</a>.</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2025-06-28-migrating-the-jena-editor-from-codemirror-5-to-6/01.png alt='Using new turtle library codemirror-lang-turtle' title='Using new turtle library codemirror-lang-turtle' style=width:auto width height><figcaption>Using new turtle library codemirror-lang-turtle</figcaption></figure><h2 id=cmscrollto-and-cmgetscrollinfo-are-gone><code>cm.scrollTo</code> and <code>cm.getScrollInfo</code> are gone</h2><p>I could not find anything in the <code>codemirror/view</code> repository (searched
code and issues), nor on the CodeMirror website. But after testing a bit
the new code, I realized that dispatching the change to update the text
content resulted in the new text appearing in the editor without any
issues to the scroll bar.</p><p>So I just removed those lines (for now, at least).</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2025-06-28-migrating-the-jena-editor-from-codemirror-5-to-6/02.png alt='Delete scroll-bar-related code' title='Delete scroll-bar-related code' style=width:auto width height><figcaption>Delete scroll-bar-related code</figcaption></figure><h2 id=no-on-to-watch-for-change-events-in-codemirror-view-element>No <code>.on</code> to watch for <code>change</code> events in CodeMirror view element</h2><p>Previously, we had some code that called <code>.on('change', ...)</code> on the
<code>cm</code> object, to listen for the events and sync it with our Vue elements.</p><p>That one would have been very hard (or at least very boring) problem to fix,
but thankfully <a href=https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/listen-to-change-event/5095>somebody else had already found it</a>.
The user message was also showing that I would have to call that method directly
on <code>EditorView</code>, and not on the <code>cm</code> instance (must be quite interesting
how they hook that up, global objects and all).</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2025-06-28-migrating-the-jena-editor-from-codemirror-5-to-6/03.png alt="Using EditorView.updateListener instead of on('change', ...)" title="Using EditorView.updateListener instead of on('change', ...)" style=width:auto width height><figcaption>Using EditorView.updateListener instead of on('change', ...)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=e2e-test-cannot-locate-codemirror-code>e2e test cannot locate <code>.CodeMirror-code</code></h2><p>The tests in Jena UI are written with Cypress, which works similarly to
Selenium. Elements are located by selectors like CSS classes. The only remaining
test failure was due to an element selected by <code>.CodeMirror-code</code> that was
not found.</p><p>So I fired the UI in offline mode &ndash; something I have always available when I
work in frontend projects &ndash; and checked the new CSS class: <code>.cm-content</code>.
Changed that, and the test passed! 🎉</p><figure class=feature><img src=/assets/posts/2025-06-28-migrating-the-jena-editor-from-codemirror-5-to-6/04.png alt='Last fix, using the right CSS class' title='Last fix, using the right CSS class' style=width:auto width height><figcaption>Last fix, using the right CSS class</figcaption></figure><p>Now the code is ready for review, and hopefully it will work well when it is
included in a future release of Jena &ndash; fingers crossed for that! 🤞</p><p>Categories:
