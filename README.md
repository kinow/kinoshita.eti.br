## Building

Built with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Jekyll](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
and some [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts. Layout based on
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) Jekyll theme.

For Linux:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve -w -i
```

For Windows:

```bash
bundle install
jekyll serve --skip-initial-build -w -i
```

`--skip-initial-build` is necessary to prevent it from copying files when building
for the first time. There are files with special characters (e.g. "SÃ£o Paulo") that
fail to be accessed with `File.utime`.
