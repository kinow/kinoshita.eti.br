In our demonstration we will be using TestLink 1.9 HEAD version, Hudson 1.366 and TestLink Hudson Plug-in 2.0-SNAPSHOT. This TestLink Hudson Plug-in version is still not released as we are finishing to code the integration between the plug-in and TAP through tap4j, an implementation of TAP - Test Anything Protocol. What is nice about this solution is that we aren&#39;t trying to use TestLink as an Automation Tool. But yes, as a Test Management Tool (what TestLink is by nature). And the choice of the Test Execution Tool is up to you, as long as you generate TAP Stream (basically, files containing a log of tests executed). We only enable you to have these tests updated on your TestLink installation, this way you can plan a Test Cycle with both Manual and Automated Tests in one single tool. And lastly but not less important, this week Testing Experience Magazine accepted a proposal of article for the next issue on Open Source Tools about this solution. So we are working very hard to release TestLink Hudson Plug-in new version and spread this Test Automation Solution through the Testing/Quality community. Cheers" />

In our demonstration we will be using TestLink 1.9 HEAD version, Hudson 1.366 and <a title="TestLink Hudson Plug-in" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/TestLink+Plugin">TestLink Hudson Plug-in</a> 2.0-SNAPSHOT. This TestLink Hudson Plug-in version is still not released as we are finishing to code the integration between the plug-in and TAP through <a title="tap4j" href="http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/">tap4j</a>, an implementation of <a title="Test Anything Protocol" href="http://www.testanything.org">TAP - Test Anything Protocol</a>.

What is nice about this solution is that we aren't trying to use TestLink as an Automation Tool. But yes, as a Test Management Tool (what TestLink is by nature). And the choice of the Test Execution Tool is up to you, as long as you generate TAP Stream (basically, files containing a log of tests executed). We only enable you to have these tests updated on your TestLink installation, this way you can plan a Test Cycle with both Manual and Automated Tests in one single tool.

And lastly but not less important, this week <a title="Testing Experience Magazine" href="http://www.testingexperience.com/">Testing Experience Magazine</a> accepted a proposal of article for the next issue on Open Source Tools about this solution. So we are working very hard to release TestLink Hudson Plug-in new version and spread this Test Automation Solution through the Testing/Quality community.
