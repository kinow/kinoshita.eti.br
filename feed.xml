&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/dsknqj/japanese_idiom_%E6%9C%9D%E9%A3%AF%E5%89%8D_asameshimae_lit_before/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;
on reddit about &lt;strong&gt;“朝飯前”&lt;/strong&gt; (asa-meshi-mae), literally “before the morning meal” in Japanese.
This is an expression that has the same meaning as &lt;strong&gt;piece of cake&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that something is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the comments in that thread, there are more examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English &lt;strong&gt;“&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; for breakfast”&lt;/strong&gt; means that something is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I eat punks like you for breakfast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chinese &lt;strong&gt;“小菜一碟”&lt;/strong&gt; (xiao3 cai4 yi4 die2) translates to &lt;strong&gt;“a plate of small dish”&lt;/strong&gt;,
and has the same meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Portuguese &lt;strong&gt;“sopa”&lt;/strong&gt; is used with the same meaning of something being very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ganhar desse time é sopa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And similarly in Spanish but with &lt;strong&gt;“pan comido”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish has &lt;strong&gt;“lätt som en plätt”&lt;/strong&gt;, which according to the comments in that thread
means &lt;strong&gt;“easy as a pancake”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In German: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;”ein Zuckerschlecken”&lt;/strong&gt; that means &lt;strong&gt;“licking sugar”&lt;/strong&gt;. And in its cousin
language Dutch: &lt;strong&gt;“dat is een eitje”&lt;/strong&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;“it’s a small egg”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“appeltje eitje”&lt;/strong&gt;
means &lt;strong&gt;“small apple small egg”&lt;/strong&gt;, both meaning that something is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think food has been associated with something being easy probably due to
how easy some food was prepared, or how easy they were to be found and eaten.
But there could be some more interesting history behind these expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="etymology" /><category term="languages" /><category term="english" /><summary type="html">Some time ago I saw this post on reddit about “朝飯前” (asa-meshi-mae), literally “before the morning meal” in Japanese.

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548&quot;&gt;“On Writing Well”&lt;/a&gt;,
Zinsser wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is a deep yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought “bombast” would be related to the Portuguese word “bombástico”,
which can mean something like fantastic, amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it has a different meaning. Google defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;high-sounding language with little meaning, used to impress people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etymonline.com/word/bombast&quot;&gt;etymology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1570s, “cotton padding,” corrupted from earlier bombace “raw cotton” (1550s), from Old French bombace “cotton, cotton wadding,” from Late Latin bombacem, accusative of bombax “cotton, ‘linteorum aut aliae quaevis quisquiliae,’ “ a corruption and transferred use of Latin bombyx “silk,” from Greek bombyx “silk, silkworm” (which also came to mean “cotton” in Medieval Greek), from some oriental word, perhaps related to Iranian pambak (modern panba) or Armenian bambok, perhaps ultimately from a PIE root meaning “to twist, wind.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also from the same source are Swedish bomull, Danish bomuld “cotton,” and, via Turkish forms, Modern Greek mpampaki, Rumanian bumbac, Serbo-Croatian pamuk. German baumwolle “cotton” probably is from the Latin word but altered by folk-etymology to look like “tree wool.” Polish bawełna, Lithuanian bovelna are partial translations from German.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From stuffing and padding for clothes or upholstery, meaning extended to “pompous, empty speech” (1580s).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bombast was originally applied to a stuff of soft, loose texture, once used to swell the garment. Fustian was also a kind of cloth of stiff expansive character. These terms are applied to a high, swelling style of writing, full of extravagant sentiments and expressions. Bathos is a word which has the same application, meaning generally the mock heroic–that “depth” into which one falls who overleaps the sublime; the step which one makes in order to pass from the sublime to the ridiculous. [James de Mille, “Elements of Rhetoric,” 1878]&lt;/p&gt;

is a book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser&quot;&gt;William Zinsser&lt;/a&gt;, published for the first time in 1976 but
already past its seventeenth edition. It is extremely well written - as it was expected
for a book with such title - and also funny and simple to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fluid&quot; src=&quot;/assets/posts/2020-01-02-science-books-and-articles-from-zinssers-on-writing-well-book/lunar-vehicle.png&quot; alt=&quot;A lunar vehicle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is full of excerpts and quotes from other books and articles, used as good or bad examples.
In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists
books and articles on the topic that were well written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition,
except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked
interesting, so I decided to include it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lists below, the author name contains a link to a Wikipedia page about him/her. And
the book title contains a non-affiliated link to Amazon, where it is possible to read a description
of the book, as well as read sample pages. Below each entry is the content of the first
paragraph of the Wikipedia page. The articles have links to existing PDF’s or the original place
where it was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rachel Louise Carson (May 27, 1907 – April 14, 1964) was an American marine biologist, author, and conservationist whose book Silent Spring and other writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution.[I] His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science.[&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Primo Michele Levi (31 July 1919 – 11 April 1987) was an Italian Jewish chemist, partisan, Holocaust survivor and writer. He was the author of several books, novels, collections of short stories, essays, and poems. His best-known works include If This Is a Man (1947, published as Survival in Auschwitz in the United States), his account of the year he spent as a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland; and The Periodic Table (1975), linked to qualities of the elements, which the Royal Institution named the best science book ever written.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sir Peter Brian Medawar OM CBE FRS (28 February 1915 – 2 October 1987) was a Brazilian-born British biologist, whose work on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired immune tolerance was fundamental to the practice of tissue and organ transplants. For his works in immunology he is regarded as the “father of transplantation”. He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as “the wittiest of all scientific writers”, and Stephen Jay Gould as “the cleverest man I have ever known”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Oliver Wolf Sacks, CBE FRCP (9 July 1933 – 30 August 2015) was a British neurologist, naturalist, historian of science, and author. Born in Britain, and mostly educated there, he spent his career in the United States. He believed that the brain is the “most incredible thing in the universe.” He became widely known for writing best-selling case histories about both his patients’ and his own disorders and unusual experiences, with some of his books adapted for plays by major playwrights, feature films, animated short films, opera, dance, fine art, and musical works in the classical genre.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stephen Jay Gould (September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science. He was also one of the most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation. Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1996, Gould was hired as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University, where he divided his time teaching there and at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stanisław Marcin Ulam (13 April 1909 – 13 May 1984) was a Polish scientist in the fields of mathematics and nuclear physics. He participated in the Manhattan Project, originated the Teller–Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons, discovered the concept of the cellular automaton, invented the Monte Carlo method of computation, and suggested nuclear pulse propulsion. In pure and applied mathematics, he proved some theorems and proposed several conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">“On Writing Well” is a book by William Zinsser, published for the first time in 1976 but already past its seventeenth edition. It is extremely well written - as it was expected for a book with such title - and also funny and simple to read. The book is full of excerpts and quotes from other books and articles, used as good or bad examples. In one of its chapters where Zinsser discusses writing about Science he lists books and articles on the topic that were well written. This post contains books and articles mentioned on page 158 of the 2006 30th anniversary edition, except for the last article written by Glenn Zorpette that was on another page - but still looked interesting, so I decided to include it anyway.</summary></entry></feed>
