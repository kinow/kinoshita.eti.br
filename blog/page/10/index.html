      Apache Commons Text LookupTranslator
    </a>
  </h3><span class="post-meta">Jun 2, 2017<span>&mdash; star date: -305501.37.</span></span>
  <span class="post-meta">Number of words: 0.</span><p><a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/">Apache Commons Text</a> includes several algorithms for text processing. Today’s post is about one of the classes available since the 1.0 release, the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/translate/LookupTranslator.html">LookupTranslator</a>.</p>

<p>It is used to translate text using a lookup table. Most users won’t necessarily be - knowingly - using this class. Most likely, they will use the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/StringEscapeUtils.html">StringEscapeUtils</a>, which contains methods to escape and unescape CSV, JSON, XML, Java, and EcmaScript.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">original</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"He didn't say, \"stop!\""</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"He didn't say, \\\"stop!\\\""</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">result</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">StringEscapeUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">escapeJava</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">original</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>StringEscapeUtils uses CharSequenceTranslator’s, including LookupTranslator. You can use it directly too, to escape other data your text may contain, special characters not supported by some third party library or system, or even a simpler case.</p>

<p>In other words, you would be creating your own StringEscapeUtils. Let’s say you have some text where numbers must never start with the zero digital, due to some restriction in the way you use that data later.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">lookupTable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">HashMap</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>
<span class="n">lookupTable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">put</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"a"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="kd">final</span> <span class="nc">LookupTranslator</span> <span class="n">escapeNumber0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">LookupTranslator</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">[][]</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="s">"0"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">});</span>
<span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">escaped</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">escapeNumber0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">translate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"There are 02 texts waiting for analysis today..."</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That way the resulting text would be “There are 2 texts waiting for analysis today”, allowing you to proceed with the rest of your analysis. This is a very simple example, but hopefully you grokked how LookupTranslator works.</p>

      Troubleshooting a Jenkins Plug-in compatibility issue

  <span class="post-meta">Number of words: 0.</span><p>This post is probably different from others. I will give a TL;DR, but will then
give you a copy of
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42655?focusedCommentId=291470&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-291470">a comment of a Jenkins JIRA issue</a>.
Hope you have fun reading it,
specially if you maintain Jenkins servers or plug-ins.</p>

<p>TL;DR: there was an issue in Jenkins Job DSL Plug-in, that caused jobs created to
have an invalid script. The fix had not been released, but was already in the
master branch in GitHub.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: #DDDDDD;">&diams;</p>

<p><em>Well, that was fun bug reproduced, I believe I know why that’s happening. Not so complicated to fix… but no fast way to fix it. Here’s the issue analysis (grab a coffee to read it).</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Downloaded jenkins.war (2.32.3.war)</em></li>
  <li><em>mkdir /tmp/123</em></li>
  <li><em>JENKINS_HOME=/tmp/123 java -jar jenkins.war</em></li>
  <li><em>Entered secret into form and submitted</em></li>
  <li><em>Installed suggested plugins (boy that takes a while)</em></li>
  <li><em>Created temp user</em></li>
  <li><em>Installed (without restart) active-choices-plugin 1.5.3</em></li>
  <li><em>Installed (without restart) job-dsl-plugin</em></li>
  <li><em>Manually stopped Jenkins, and started it again with same command #3</em></li>
  <li><em>Log in with user, all looking good</em></li>
  <li><em>Created Freestyle job JENKINS-42655 (see attached config.xml)</em></li>
  <li><em>Executed job, and found new job JENKINS-42655-1</em></li>
  <li><em>Never opened the job configuration, clicked on the “Generated Items link to JENKINS-42655-1” to open in a new tab</em></li>
  <li><em>Clicked on Build with Parameters</em></li>
  <li><em>Looked at logs, and noticed the security-script-plugin exceptions</em></li>
  <li><em>Went to “Manage Jenkins” / “In-process Script Approval” and approved scripts</em></li>
  <li><em>Went back to the JENKINS-42655-1 build with parameters screen, and everything worked as expected</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Hummm. Issue more or less reproduced. Let’s investigate more.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Restarted Jenkins again</em></li>
  <li><em>Changed the JENKINS-42655 seed job configuration to use a different script</em></li>
  <li><em>Copied the config.xml file to another location</em></li>
  <li><em>Went to build with parameters, and now it was broken again</em></li>
  <li><em>Saved the job manually</em></li>
  <li><em>Copied the config.xml file to yet another location</em></li>
  <li><em>Went to build with parameters, and now it worked as reported in this issue</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Now comes the interesting part. Looking at the diff. Attaching a screen shot so that others can have fun looking at it too. I installed Kompare as it has some cool features such as disabling diff for white spaces, blank lines, etc. The whole file changes as you save it. But if you ignore the number of white spaces… Then you can see that the Job DSL Plug-in is creating a &lt;script&gt; tag, as we used to do before 1.5 I think.</em></p>

*Now we use the script-security-plugin. So we need to wrap that around the script-security-plugin's tags. Will report an issue for job-dsl-plugin, and will probably submit a pull request in the next days too. There's not much left we can change in the plug-in code for that Piotr Tempes, so I'm afraid you will have to:*

* *keep saving the job*
* *perhaps work on the fix for Job DSL if you feel like doing it (as you could probably be faster than me in submitting the PR)*
* *use an older version of the active-choices-plugin that doesn't use security-script-plugin, though you could be bitten by other old bugs*
* *write some script to replace the &lt;script&gt; tag and wrap it by the secureScript (doing what the pull request will do automatically later)*

*Sorry for not being able to quickly provide any workaround, nor to cut a quick bugfix release.*

*Cheers*
*Bruno*

ps: When I started getting involved in Open Source, I always felt extremely happy when
people would spend their time troubleshooting my issues, or just educating me on how to
behave in an Open Source community, or even how I should have troubleshooted initially
the issue myself. So whenever I have time, I try to write detailed and polite replies. The
person posting the comment is my past. The person posting the comment is my future :-)

      Writing a binary parser in Python: NumPy vs. Construct
    </a>
  </h3><span class="post-meta">Apr 14, 2017<span>&mdash; star date: -305635.62.</span></span>
  <span class="post-meta">Number of words: 0.</span><p>Some time ago I worked with researchers to write a parser for an old data format. The data
was generated by device (radiosonde) using the vendor (Vaisala) specific binary format.</p>

<p>One of the researchers told me someone had written a parser for his work, and shared it
on GitHub. To be honest, that was my first time parsing data in binary with Python. Did
that before with C, C++, Perl, and Java, but never with Python.</p>

<p>The code on GitHub used <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and looked similar to this one.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>

    <span class="c1"># ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it indeed worked fine. But in the end I used the code - after contacting the author and letting
him know what I was about to do - as reference together with an old specification document
for the format, and created a parser with <a href="https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Construct</a>.</p>

<p>From Construct’s website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Construct is a powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data.</p>

<p>This is what the code with construct looked like.</p>

<p>Writing the parser with NumPy or Construct would achieve the same result. However, in the end
this came down to personal preference, and my point of view as Software Engineer. This is the
description of NumPy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NumPy is a project tailored for scientific computing, with a focus on linear algebra,
N-dimensional arrays, and so it goes. While it contains code that can parse binary data,
the footprint added to a project that includes it as dependency is quite big.</p>

<p>The parser written with NumPy wasn’t using 5% of the NumPy code base. Probably less than 1%. Updates
to NumPy could break the application compatibility, even if the update came due to some new
matrix operation added to NumPy through some external and missing dependency.</p>

<p>In Java something similar happens with Google Guava. While I use it some times, most of the
times I find myself using one of the Apache Commons libraries, or another dependency
with just what I need. To avoid including unnecessary code to my application.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use NumPy that’s fine too :-) I just had the time enough to rewrite it
instead of using the NumPy (took a couple of hours). In other cases it may still
make sense to use another tool or library, even if it was not made specifically for the
job ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
