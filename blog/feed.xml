Many are already on the GitHub Actions Market Place and a few lines of YAML are enough.
A Codecov coverage report We had to report the test coverage of a private GitHub repository of a project I am working on at the moment, that could not have integration with other services besides GitHub.</description></item><item><title>r/functionalprogramming turned 10</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2022/10/26/r/functionalprogramming-turned-10.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 19:30:52 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2022/10/26/r/functionalprogramming-turned-10.html</guid><description>Last week r/functionalprogramming turned 10 years old! Time passed very quickly since I created the subreddit.
I had heard about functional programming before at university and from co-workers, but hadn't much need for it at work. But when I started working on Apache Commons Functor, I realized I needed somewhere to start collecting all the blog posts, papers, and other links I was finding on a part of the Internet I had no idea it existed before.</description></item><item><title>Cyclic Workflows with Prefect</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/11/08/cyclic-workflows-with-prefect.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/11/08/cyclic-workflows-with-prefect.html</guid><description>&lt;div style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">

&lt;p>Last month I wrote about
&lt;a href="https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/10/01/cyclic-workflows-with-cylc-and-stackstorm.html">Cyclic Workflows with Cylc and StackStorm&lt;/a>
and how few workflow managers support cyclic workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was surprised today while reading Prefect documentation to see this paragraph:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most workflow frameworks act as if looping is impossible (stressing the Acyclic part of the DAG),
but it&amp;rsquo;s actually trivial to implement. We simply dynamically unroll the loop, similar to how RNN
gradients are sometimes computed.&lt;/p>

GitHub Notifications icon always-on mode I tried changing the filters, waiting for a new notification to appear so that I could mark it as read, all hoping that icon would then change. But no matter what I tried in the GitHub UI, the icon was still there.</description></item><item><title>Blender rendering on NVIDIA Jetson Nano</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/10/17/blender-rendering-on-nvidia-jetson-nano.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/10/17/blender-rendering-on-nvidia-jetson-nano.html</guid><description>NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer I had used Blender during my graduation at the Mackenzie University and started learning Blender 2.8+ again a few weeks ago. Unfortunately rendering the basic tutorials like Andrew Price&amp;rsquo;s donut takes several minutes on my old (but excellent for programming) Thinkpad T550 i7 16 GB with a simple Samsung SSD. The reason is that my GPU, a NVIDIA NVS 5400M with 2 GB memory and 96 cores cannot be used with Blender as it only supports CUDA 2.</description></item><item><title>Cyclic Workflows with Cylc and StackStorm</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/10/01/cyclic-workflows-with-cylc-and-stackstorm.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/10/01/cyclic-workflows-with-cylc-and-stackstorm.html</guid><description>I am aware of only two workflow managers that support cyclic workflows. Cylc and StackStorm. I won&amp;rsquo;t enter into details about these two tools, but I must note that I worked on Cylc during my employment with NIWA, in New Zealand.
In this post I will only show a very simple workflow called five first using Cylc, and then the same workflow with StackStorm.
Cylc First let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the source code of this workflow with Cylc 8 and plot it.</description></item><item><title>Random traffic light</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/04/06/random-traffic-light.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/04/06/random-traffic-light.html</guid><description>From a reference photo found on Twitter.

Not having used Inkscape for low poly before, I decided to give it a try.
After reading a handful of tutorials, I realized it is a very interesting and relaxing process. You use a reference photo with low opacity as background, and then create the polygons manually with a vector pen.</description></item><item><title>Yandê pães logo</title><link>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/03/07/yand%C3%AA-p%C3%A3es-logo.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kinoshita.eti.br/2021/03/07/yand%C3%AA-p%C3%A3es-logo.html</guid><description>Logo created on Inkscape, based on ideas and sketches given by customer.
