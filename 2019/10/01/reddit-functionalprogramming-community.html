Fast forward a few years, the community is still active, with a healthy group of nearly 10.000 readers and contributors. Nowadays I spend something like 5 to 20 minutes everyday moderating posts. And a little more than that whenever I find some interesting post to read. But if I could change one thing in the community, it would be to find more moderators. It is a huge responsibility to be the sole moderator of content read by thousands of readers. Whilst I try to stay neutral, and keep it a healthy community, I feel like having other people with different background and opinions would be good for the future of the community." />

<p><a href="https://reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/">r/functionalprogramming</a> was created nearly seven years ago.
It started when I was interested in contributing to
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-functor/">Apache Commons Functor</a>.</p>

<p>I created it to have a place to collect links about functional programming. To my surprise there was
no subreddit for functional programming. So I created one. Fast forward a few years, the community is
still active, with a healthy group of nearly 10.000 readers and contributors.</p>

<p>Nowadays I spend something like 5 to 20 minutes everyday moderating posts. And a little more than that whenever I
find some interesting post to read. But if I could change one thing in the community, it would be to find
more moderators.</p>

<p>It is a huge responsibility to be the sole moderator of content read by thousands of readers.
Whilst I try to stay neutral, and keep it a healthy community, I feel like having other
people with different background and opinions would be good for the future of the community.</p>
